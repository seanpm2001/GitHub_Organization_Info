Delete notes for 2022, Saturday, August 13th
---

Pictures have been provided that have the necessary details to recreate these organizations properly in the future.
The complexity is gone. What I have left is easy. It has never really been too complex, as I enjoy doing this.

Today, I deleted 80 organizations, ending with only 240 to go. I will likely finish in 3 days.

As of 2022, Saturday, August 13th at 3:23 pm PST, seanpm2001-all, and seanwallawalla-forks are still present on the list,
despite being deleted over 96 hours ago, and returning a 404 page when visiting them.
This has been a problem since 2022, Monday, August 9th.

I suffered significant losses today, some of my most important organizations had to be deleted. There were some really
special ones today.

Yesterday, I have noted that my "what's left" screenshot contains an error (Firefox has been wrapping my username across a whole
line of the list) it is possible to be fixed in the future with data and image manipulation.
I still got the screenshot of this category for today.
