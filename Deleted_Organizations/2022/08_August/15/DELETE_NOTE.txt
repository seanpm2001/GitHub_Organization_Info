Delete notes for 2022, Monday, August 15th
---

Pictures have been provided that have the necessary details to recreate these organizations properly in the future.
The complexity is gone. What I have left is easy. It has never really been too complex, as I enjoy doing this.

Today, I deleted 80 more organizations, ending with only 80 to go. I will likely finish tomorrow.
I likely won't have my main account back the same day as I delete the last remaining organization.

As of 2022, Monday, August 15th at 2:50 pm PST, seanpm2001-all, and seanwallawalla-forks are still present on the list,
despite being deleted over 144 hours ago, and returning a 404 page when visiting them.
This has been a problem since 2022, Monday, August 9th.

I went through and deleted 80 SNU organizations today. There would be only 1 unique icon left if seanpm2001-all and
seanwallawalla-forks would have deleted by now.

3 days ago, I have noted that my "what's left" screenshot contains an error (Firefox has been wrapping my username across a whole
line of the list) it is possible to be fixed in the future with data and image manipulation.
I still got the screenshot of this category for 2022, Saturday, August 13th, despite the error.
The screenshot for 2022, Sunday, August 14th did not contain the error. The same is true for the 2022, Monday, August 15th
screenshots.
