Delete notes for 2022, Tuesday, August 16th
---

Pictures have been provided that have the necessary details to recreate these organizations properly in the future.
The complexity is gone. What I have left is easy. It has never really been too complex, as I enjoy doing this.

Today, I deleted the last 80 organizations, I am now 100% done with this task. I am still deciding on if I should
send an appeal, or wait to get my account back.

As of 2022, Tuesday, August 16th at 3:05 pm PST, seanpm2001-all, and seanwallawalla-forks are still present on the list,
despite being deleted over 168 hours (1 week) ago, and returning a 404 page when visiting them.
This has been a problem since 2022, Monday, August 9th.

I went through and deleted the last 80 SNU organizations today.

4 days ago, I have noted that my "what's left" screenshot contains an error (Firefox has been wrapping my username across a whole
line of the list) it is possible to be fixed in the future with data and image manipulation.
I still got the screenshot of this category for 2022, Saturday, August 13th, despite the error.
The screenshot for 2022, Sunday, August 14th did not contain the error. The same is true for the 2022, Monday, August 15th and 
2022, Tuesday, August 16th screenshots.
