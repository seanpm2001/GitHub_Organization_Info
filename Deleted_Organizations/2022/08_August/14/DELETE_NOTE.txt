Delete notes for 2022, Sunday, August 14th
---

Pictures have been provided that have the necessary details to recreate these organizations properly in the future.
The complexity is gone. What I have left is easy. It has never really been too complex, as I enjoy doing this.

Today, I deleted 80 more organizations, ending with only 160 to go. I will likely finish in 2 days.
I likely won't have my main account back the same day as I delete the last remaining organization.

As of 2022, Sunday, August 14th at 5:03 pm PST, seanpm2001-all, and seanwallawalla-forks are still present on the list,
despite being deleted over 120 hours ago, and returning a 404 page when visiting them.
This has been a problem since 2022, Monday, August 9th.

I finished deleting all non-SNU organizations today.

2 days ago, I have noted that my "what's left" screenshot contains an error (Firefox has been wrapping my username across a whole
line of the list) it is possible to be fixed in the future with data and image manipulation.
I still got the screenshot of this category for 2022, Saturday, August 13th, despite the error.
The screenshot for 2022, Sunday, August 14th did not contain the error.
