Delete notes for 2022 August 10th

Pictures have been provided that have the necessary details to recreate these organizations properly in the future.
Things are going to become more complex when I get higher up the list, as I will have to deal with:
- constant multi-page organizations

Yesterday (2022, August 9th) I tackled highly developed/sophisticated organizations, which took more time and resources to document. As of over an hour after deletion, seanpm2001-all and seanwallawalla-forks return a 404 page, but still show up with their icons on my profile. I did the same on 2022 August 10th.

seanwallawalla-software was originally not listed in my deleted organization list, after going back through the list after completing todays work, I found I deleted 81 organizations, instead of the target 80. I will do 79 tomorrow, instead of 80.

As of 2022, Wednesday, August 10th at 4:58 pm PST, seanpm2001-all, and seanwallawalla-forks are still present on the list, despite being deleted over 24 hours ago, and returning a 404 page when visiting them.

Here were some of my key targets today:
