Delete notes for 2022 August 7th

Pictures have been provided that have the necessary details to recreate these organizations properly in the future.
Things are going to become more complex when I get higher up the list, as I will have to deal with:
- constant multi-page organizations
- GitHub Pages data (no longer a problem, as of 2022, Sunday, August 7th)
- Snapcraft package data (no longer a problem, as of 2022, Sunday, August 7th)

On 2022, Sunday, August 7th, I took care of GitHub Pages and Snapcraft package data beforehand, so these won't be an issue. Multi-page organizations will still be a problem.
Some personal notes from backing up GitHub Pages and Snapcraft data today:
- DeGoogle-your-life.github.io didn't have a development branch, don't worry future self, you didn't forget anything here
- TouchPetsDogs2Rewritten-Snap is a complete duplicate of its successor. I have checked. There is no need to worry.
