Delete notes for 2022 August 11th

Pictures have been provided that have the necessary details to recreate these organizations properly in the future.
The complexity is gone. What I have left is easy. It has never really been too complex, as I enjoy doing this.

Today, I deleted 79 organizations, instead of 80, due to my error of deleting 81 organizations yesterday.

As of 2022, Wednesday, August 11th at 5:53 pm PST, seanpm2001-all, and seanwallawalla-forks are still present on the list,
despite being deleted over 48 hours ago, and returning a 404 page when visiting them.
This has been a problem since 2022, Monday, August 9th.
