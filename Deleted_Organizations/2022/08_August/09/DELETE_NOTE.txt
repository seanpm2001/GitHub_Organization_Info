Delete notes for 2022 August 9th

Pictures have been provided that have the necessary details to recreate these organizations properly in the future.
Things are going to become more complex when I get higher up the list, as I will have to deal with:
- constant multi-page organizations

Today (2022, August 9th) I tackled highly developed/sophisticated organizations, which took more time and resources to document. As of over an hour after deletion, seanpm2001-all and seanwallawalla-forks return a 404 page, but still show up with their icons on my profile.
I am also clearing way for a wall of SNU organizations, trying to create a huge consecutive block of them as something to keep me sane while I delete over a years worth of progress. I am almost halfway done, and am expected to finish in 7 days at the current rate.
