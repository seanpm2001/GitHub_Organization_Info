# Deleting organizations

On 2022, Tuesday, July 19th, I was flagged on GitHub, but didn't get a response as to why until 2022, Wednesday, August 3rd. The reason was because of my organizations. I am now documenting and deleting the organizations, they will be recreated in the future on a different platform. It is a significant loss to me, and the GitHub community.

Originally, I became hopeless, as despite having such a huge loss, GitHub denied my request to have them delete all my organizations for me, and now I have to do it manually. This later turned out to be a good thing, as I needed to salvage the data. The option to delete organizations myself wasn't visible until after the response, originally, it said to contact them about deleting each individual organization.

Work is being done to ensure they can be recreated exactly. The deletion process started on August 5th, and is ongoing. It is expected to be finished by 2022, August 16th, but I likely won't get my account back on the same day.

**Deletion log notes:**

**Daily log:**

**Day 1:** _The 140 organizations deleted today don't have in-depth screenshots, as the organizations were empty, and already had screenshot documentation of themselves._

**Day 2:** _80 organizations were deleted today, in-depth screenshots started today as well._

**Day 3:** _I had a difficult time today, and was only able to delete 60 organizations._

**Day 4:** _I now plan to delete 80 organizations per day consistently until I finish deleting all of them._

**Day 5:** _I continued with the plan of deleting 80 per day today. `seanpm2001-all` and `seanwallawalla-forks` were deleted, but still persist on my profile, despite the fact that any user (even me) that visits them gets a 404 error._

**Day 6:** _I accidentally deleted 1 extra organization today._

**Day 7:** _I deleted 79 organizations today, instead of 80, to even out yesterdays mistake. I will continue to delete organizations 80 at a time tomorrow._

**Day 8:** _I went back to deleting 80 organizations per day today. I expect to finish in 4 days. Today, I also have noted that my "what's left" screenshot contains an error (Firefox has been wrapping my username across a whole line of the list) it is possible to be fixed in the future with data and image manipulation._

**Day 9:** _I suffered significant losses today, some of my most important organizations had to be deleted. There were some really special ones today._

**Additional log:**

The organizations `Seanpm2001-all` and `seanwallawalla-forks` were deleted on 2022, Thursday, August 9th. As of 2022, Saturday, August 13th, they still appear on my profile, despite being completely deleted, with no way for me or anyone else to access them (you just get a 404 page) it has been over 96 hours.

On 2022 Monday, August 8th, I decided to set the amount of orgs deleted per day to 80 (8x8=64) so that I can have a consistent and measured reduction in just 8 days. I expect to finish on 2022, Tuesday, August 16th. If things don't go as planned, it may take longer.

I updated my second account ([`@seanwallawalla`](https://github.com/seanwallawalla/)) on 2022 August 9th, removing the reference to `seanwallawalla-software` and changing the location to match my main account.
