# Deleting organizations

On 2022, Tuesday, July 19th, I was flagged on GitHub, but didn't get a response as to why until 2022, Wednesday, August 3rd. The reason was because of my organizations. I am now documenting and deleting the organizations, they will be recreated in the future on a different platform. It is a significant loss to me, and the GitHub community.

Originally, I became hopeless, as despite having such a huge loss, GitHub denied my request to have them delete all my organizations for me, and now I have to do it manually. This later turned out to be a good thing, as I needed to salvage the data. The option to delete organizations myself wasn't visible until after the response, originally, it said to contact them about deleting each individual organization.

Work is being done to ensure they can be recreated exactly. The deletion process started on August 5th, and is ongoing. It is going to take a minimum of 1 week, and a maximum of 5 weeks.

## Progress

| Date | # of Organizations deleted today | # of organizations deleted total | Percentage of total |  Total % |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Day 1, 2022, Friday, August 5th | 140 | 140 | 14.0% | 14.0% |
| Day 2, 2022, Saturday, August 6th | 80 | 220 | 08.0% | 22.0% |
| Day 3, Coming soon | :x: | :x: | :x: | :x: |
