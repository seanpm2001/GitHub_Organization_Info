# Version 1.1.48B - 2022 Friday, March 25th

## V1.1.48B

### Changes:

<details open><summary><p lang="en">Click/tap here to expand/collapse the lead section</p></summary>

This is the Hundred-thirty-fourth release of this project. It contains the basic data for 840 organizations (fork count minus 2) related notes, and images. It is missing data for 2 organizations. This is the actual 133rd release. I made a mistake with the 44th release, and upon fixing it, it created a duplicate release. This notice is getting kind of dated (old) but it explains why this is V134 and not V135. I intend to keep it until it makes a large enough dent. For now, I just plan to keep this notice as long as possible.

This is the eighth set of releases for the year of 2022, as I made time to work on this project on 2022 Friday, March 25th. I have plans to continue for a minimum of 9 more consecutive weeks, the number hasn't changed, as more entries are still being added on an almost-daily basis.

I received my first external fork on this project 3 weeks ago, and now the fork count can't be relied upon for getting the organization count. Luckily, I have plenty of other indicators and measures for this. I was hoping I could get to 1000 before this happened, but it's fine.

See below for more changes.

# Version 1.1.44B - 2022 Friday, February 25th

## V1.1.44B

### Changes:

This is the Hundred-twenty-sixth release of this project. It contains the basic data for 800 organizations, <!-- (fork count minus 2) !--> related notes, and images. It is missing data for 2 organizations. This is the actual 126th release. I made a mistake with the 44th release, and upon fixing it, it created a duplicate release. This notice is getting kind of dated (old) but it explains why this is V126 and not V127. I intend to keep it until it makes a large enough dent. For now, I just plan to keep this notice as long as possible.

This is the fourth set of releases for the year of 2022, as I made time to work on this project on 2022 Friday, February 25th.

I really did not expect it to take this long today. It went on for 2-5 hours longer than expected.

See below for more changes.

### Changes

This is version 126, the B variant of version 125 to 126. It includes the following changes:

# Version 1.1.39A - 2021 December 7th

## V1.1.39A

### Changes:

This is the Hundred-fifteenth release of this project. It contains the basic data for 745 organizations, <!-- (fork count minus 2) !--> related notes, and images. It is missing data for 2 organizations. This is the actual 115th release. I made a mistake with the 44th release, and upon fixing it, it created a duplicate release. This notice is getting kind of dated (old) but it explains why this is V115 and not V116. I intend to keep it until it makes a large enough dent. For now, I just plan to keep this notice as long as possible.

The current batch today is part of 3 or more batches for the first half of December. Depending on how much time I have this week, it will either be finished by Wednesday, or Thursday.

See below for more changes.

### Changes

This is version 115, the A variant of version 115 to 116. It includes the following changes:

### Changes:

This is the Hundred-twelfth release of this project. It contains the basic data for 730 organizations, <!-- (fork count minus 2) !--> related notes, and images.

The current batch of new organizations concluded on 2021 November 28th, but I didn't get to publishing the set of releases until the next day, as I ran out of time.

This is the Hundred-tenth release of this project. It contains the basic data for 726 organizations, <!-- (fork count minus 2) !--> related notes, and images. It is missing data for 2 organizations.

For now, I just plan to keep this notice as long as possible.

I started another batch of organizations off a new growing list, I only did the language organizations today. I plan to do the rest tomorrow. This release also contains higher level documentation, as the documentation level was upgraded today.

# Version 1.1.33A - 2021 November 10th

## V1.1.33A

### Changes:

This is the Hundred-third release of this project. It contains the basic data for 700 organizations, <!-- (fork count minus 2) !--> related notes, and images. It is missing data for 2 organizations. This is the actual 103rd release. I made a mistake with the 44th release, and upon fixing it, it created a duplicate release. This notice is getting kind of dated (old) but it explains why this is V103 and not V104. I intend to keep it until it makes a large enough dent. For now, I just plan to keep this notice as long as possible. This set of releases is coming 1 day late, as I ran out of time yesterday.

See below for more changes.

### Changes

This is version 103, the A variant of version 103 to 104. It includes the following changes:

# Version 1.1.18A - 2021 September 12th

## V1.1.18A

### Changes:

This is the Seventy-fifth release of this project. It contains the basic data for 656 organizations, <!-- (fork count minus 2) !--> related notes, and images. It is missing data for 2 organizations.

This notice is getting kind of dated (old) but it explains why this is V75 and not V76. I intend to keep it until it makes a large enough dent. For now, I just plan to keep this notice as long as possible.

This release is coming 4 days late, as I haven't had the time or will to work on this project for the past 4 days. This is the 2021 September 12th series of updates, but it is being released on 2021 September 16th

## V1.1.8B

### Changes:

This is the fifty-sixth release of this project. It contains the basic data for 634 organizations, <!-- (fork count minus 2) !--> related notes, and images. It is missing data for 2 organizations. This is the actual 56th release. I made a mistake with the 44th release, and upon fixing it, it created a duplicate release. This notice is getting kind of dated (old) but it explains why this is V56 and not V57. I intend to keep it until it makes a large enough dent. For now, I just plan to keep this notice as long as possible.

This set of releases came 1 day late, as I didn't have time the previous day, as I got so much done and didn't have time for more.

### Changes

This is version 56, the B variant of version 55 to 56. It includes the following changes:

- [x] Updated discussion data

- [x] Updated release data

<!-- 
- [x] Added data up to August 2nd 2021
!-->

- [x] Deleted 1 `IGNORE.md` file
