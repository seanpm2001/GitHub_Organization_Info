# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This project is a model project and it shouldn't be much of a problem security-wise, as it isn't much of a program, rather than an information set. I decided to include a security policy to further complete this project and make it a better model.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

DO NOT REPORT A ZERO DAY VULNERABILITY PUBLICLY!

Please instead direct message me via Email. If there is no response within 90 days, you can post the vulnerability as an issue, as part of the standard 0 day security exploit reporting guidelines.

If a vulnerability is caused by an outdated dependancy, you can report it publicly, as it usually isn't that much of a problem.

Other security currently isn't available. If there are any further questions, email me at [seanpm2001-mailing-list@protonmail.com](mailto:seanpm2001-mailing-list@protonmail.com)

## Account security

If there is an account security problem regarding an organization (2FA problem, password leak, rogue member, etc.) notify me privately. Be a good samaritan.

## Non-security reports

Confidential problems that aren't related to security should be messaged to me privately. Non-confidential problems that aren't related to security should be [mentioned in an issue.](https://github.com/seanpm2001/GitHub_Organization_Info/issues/)

## Before you report

Please make sure to read key project documentation before reporting a security problem.
