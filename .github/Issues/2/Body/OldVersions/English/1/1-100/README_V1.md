### Documentation issue: cannot locate 3 organizations

I have been spending a lot of time lately creating organization categories and documenting them. The documenting process was a bit newer, and it took me a while to catch up. On May 29th 2021, I finally got caught up, except for 3 organizations that I am having difficulty finding and separating from the rest. There are currently 312 organizations (May 29th 2021) 322 organizations (May 30th 2021) but I can't find these 3 organizations. They still need to be documented.

I have tried to find them. I originally hoped it was just a miscalculation, but it wasn't. I know it is in the range of 1-260, and likely a bit smaller than 260.

If anyone sees one of my organizations that isn't listed in `///AdditionalInfo/1/` please report it to me in this issue. If nobody finds them, I will eventually find them at some point.

This is mostly a personal issue, and I don't expect much community involvement, but it would still be nice.
