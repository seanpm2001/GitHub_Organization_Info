### [Chore] Add template: `GOI_EMPTY_STRUCT` to years 2020 and 2021

I began adding the following structure to all daily entries in 2022:

```
/Generated/README.md
/Generated/README_V1.md
/Unused/README.md
/Unused/README_V1.md
/Unused/Project_Files/README.md
/Unused/Project_Files/README_V1.md
/Used/README.md
/Used/README_V1.md
```

Which is used to indicate that there is no data of these types for the specified days, and is a placeholder. It is a newer structure associated with the latest version of the entry `README.md` file. It was applied to 2022 January 1st to 2022 March 31st today, but needs to be applied to older entries, and older entries need to gain this `README.md` improvement. I don't feel like doing it today, so I am assigning it as a chore to do later.

The template is located at [`/Templates/GOI_EMPTY_STRUCT/`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/GitHub_Organization_Info/tree/main/Templates/GOI_EMPTY_STRUCT/)
