### [Goal/ToDo] Create new lighter versions

I am considering branching off versions of this repository to create lighter definitions of the project database. There will be separate branches/packages that reduce the size by:

- [ ] Removing image files
- [ ] Removing archive files (`_V1`, `_V2`, etc.)

This will be done on 3 branches:

- **branch://**`GOI_Lite_NoImage1` (just image files are removed)
- **branch://**`GOI_Lite_Extreme` (image files and archive files are removed)
- **branch://**`GOI_Lite_Simple` (just archive files are removed)

I don't know how to maintain it at the moment. If I create branches to do this, I would have to do the same thing to 2-4 branches. For now, this idea is on hold. This specific version of the database would reduce the download size by over 1 gigabyte.
