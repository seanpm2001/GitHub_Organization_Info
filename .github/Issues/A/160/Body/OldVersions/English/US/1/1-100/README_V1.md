### [Maintenance/ToDo] MyGOI is severely out of date

The concept of MyGOI, the subproject that aims to let others create a similar GitHub organization Info project, is severely out of date, and needs maintenance. It is not functional, and it has hardly any structure to it. It may even need to be separated into another project.

Reference: `MyGOI` is located [here](https://github.com/seanpm2001/GitHub_Organization_Info/tree/main/MyGOI/)
