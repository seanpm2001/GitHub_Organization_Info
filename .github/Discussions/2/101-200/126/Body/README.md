# Version 1.1.41A - 2022 Thursday, January 6th

## V1.1.41A

### Changes:

This is the Hundred-ninth release of this project. It contains the basic data for 770 organizations, <!-- (fork count minus 2) !--> related notes, and images. It is missing data for 2 organizations. This is the actual 119th release. I made a mistake with the 44th release, and upon fixing it, it created a duplicate release. This notice is getting kind of dated (old) but it explains why this is V119 and not V120. I intend to keep it until it makes a large enough dent. For now, I just plan to keep this notice as long as possible.

This is the first set of releases for the year of 2022, as I made time to work on this project on 2022 Wednesday, January 6th.
See below for more changes.
