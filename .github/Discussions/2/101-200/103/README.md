# Version 1.1.31A - 2021 November 3rd

## V1.1.31A

### Changes:

This is the Ninety-ninth release of this project. It contains the basic data for 690 organizations, <!-- (fork count minus 2) !--> related notes, and images. It is missing data for 2 organizations. This is the actual 99th release. I made a mistake with the 44th release, and upon fixing it, it created a duplicate release. This notice is getting kind of dated (old) but it explains why this is V99 and not V100. I intend to keep it until it makes a large enough dent. For now, I just plan to keep this notice as long as possible. This set of releases is coming 1 day late, as I ran out of time yesterday.

See below for more changes.
