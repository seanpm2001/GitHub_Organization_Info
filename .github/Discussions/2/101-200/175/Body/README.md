## V1.1.61B

### Changes:

<details open><summary><p lang="en">Click/tap here to expand/collapse the lead section</p></summary>

This is the Hundred-sixtieth release of this project. It contains the basic data for 970 organizations, related notes, and images. It is missing data for 2 organizations. This is the actual 160th release. I made a mistake with the 44th release, and upon fixing it, it created a duplicate release. This notice is getting kind of dated (old) but it explains why this is V160 and not V161. I intend to keep it until it makes a large enough dent. For now, I just plan to keep this notice as long as possible.

This is the twenty-first set of releases for the year of 2022, as I made time to work on this project on 2022 Friday, June 24th. I have plans to continue for a minimum of 10 more consecutive weeks. <!-- The number hasn't gone down, as more entries are still being added on an almost-daily basis. !--> I will return again on 2022, Friday, July 1st.

I received my first external fork on this project on 2022 March 18th, and now the fork count can't be relied upon for getting the organization count. Luckily, I have plenty of other indicators and measures for this. I was hoping I could get to 1000 before this happened, but it's fine. There has been another external fork on 2022 April 1st as well (total -forks not by me, as of this release: 2)

On Monday, 2022 April 11th, GitHub released an update with bad performance that redirects project forks to a page I cannot access (it only times out and gives me a unicorn error) I cannot fork any repositories at the moment, including this one. I am working on making a tool to automate forks, so I don't have to spend time with it. I feel this will save me time. 

See below for more changes.
