# Version 1.1.20A - 2021 September 17th

## V1.1.20A

### Changes:

This is the Seventy-ninth release of this project. It contains the basic data for 663 organizations, <!-- (fork count minus 2) !--> related notes, and images. It is missing data for 2 organizations. This is the actual 79th release. I made a mistake with the 44th release, and upon fixing it, it created a duplicate release. This notice is getting kind of dated (old) but it explains why this is V79 and not V80. I intend to keep it until it makes a large enough dent. For now, I just plan to keep this notice as long as possible.

This release is coming 3 days late, as I haven't had the time or motivation to do it due to personal reasons. I am going through some changes, and I needed to take it easy for a while.
