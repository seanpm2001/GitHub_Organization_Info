# Version 1.1.28B - 2021 October 18th

## V1.1.28B

### Changes:

This is the Ninety-fourth release of this project. It contains the basic data for 673 organizations, <!-- (fork count minus 2) !--> related notes, and images. It is missing data for 2 organizations. This is the actual 94th release. I made a mistake with the 44th release, and upon fixing it, it created a duplicate release. This notice is getting kind of dated (old) but it explains why this is V94 and not V95. I intend to keep it until it makes a large enough dent. For now, I just plan to keep this notice as long as possible.

See below for more changes.
