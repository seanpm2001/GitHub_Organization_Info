# Version 1.1.13A - August 20th 2021

## V1.1.13A

### Changes:

This is the sixty-fifth release of this project. It contains the basic data for 647 organizations, <!-- (fork count minus 2) !--> related notes, and images. It is missing data for 2 organizations. This is the actual 65th release. I made a mistake with the 44th release, and upon fixing it, it created a duplicate release. This notice is getting kind of dated (old) but it explains why this is V65 and not V66. I intend to keep it until it makes a large enough dent. For now, I just plan to keep this notice as long as possible.

### Changes

This is version 65, the A variant of version 65 to 66. It includes the following changes:

- [x] Updated discussion data
