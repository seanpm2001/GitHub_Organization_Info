# Version 1.1.24B - 2021 October 12th

## V1.1.24B

### Changes:

This is the Eighty-eighth release of this project. It contains the basic data for 667 organizations, <!-- (fork count minus 2) !--> related notes, and images. It is missing data for 2 organizations. This is the actual 88th release. I made a mistake with the 44th release, and upon fixing it, it created a duplicate release. This notice is getting kind of dated (old) but it explains why this is V88 and not V89. I intend to keep it until it makes a large enough dent. For now, I just plan to keep this notice as long as possible.

This set of releases is a bit late, I should have been doing daily releases for 4 days now, as I have been updating this project daily. I have been working on adding status files for every day between 2020 January 1st and 2021 December 31st (but October 13th and later will be done on a day-by-day basis) it has been a long process, with tons of README file creation, and mass commits (there is expected to be at least 1000 commits for this side project)

This release is also coming 1 day late, I wanted to release this set of releases on 2021, Tuesday October 12th, but I was having issues and ran out of time last night.

See below for more changes.
