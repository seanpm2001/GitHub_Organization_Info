# Version 1.1.21A - 2021 September 20th

## V1.1.21A

### Changes:

This is the Eighty-first release of this project. It contains the basic data for 665 organizations, <!-- (fork count minus 2) !--> related notes, and images. It is missing data for 2 organizations. This is the actual 80th release. I made a mistake with the 44th release, and upon fixing it, it created a duplicate release. This notice is getting kind of dated (old) but it explains why this is V81 and not V82. I intend to keep it until it makes a large enough dent. For now, I just plan to keep this notice as long as possible.

### Changes

This is version 81, the A variant of version 81 to 82. It includes the following changes:

- [x] Updated discussion data

- [x] Updated release data

- [x] Added data up to 2021 September 20th
