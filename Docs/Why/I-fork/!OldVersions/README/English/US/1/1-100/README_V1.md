## Why I fork

This document goes over the reason why I fork projects.

I used to frequently fork projects on GitHub, until an update came along, and made it too hard for my browser to fork projects, so I will talk about forks before 2022 April here.

When I first got into creating organizations, I just cloned my projects over. It was highly ineffective, and didn't allow for quick update refreshing. So eventually, I switched to forks.

I fork my repositories based on category and subject. I don't apply the same rules to other projects entirely (unless it is highly related, such as Ruffle-RS being forked to Seanpm2001-Rust)

When the ability to download organizations comes in the future, the forked repositories contain all the internal and external tools needed to build and use the projects. This is why core projects are forked to every organization. It is also there for easy access.

Over 99.9% of the time, I do not modify forks.

In 2021, I started additionally forking all projects to my own account as well.

Benefits of forking include:

- Quick access to all files

- Easily being able to fetch upstrea,

- Creating a point in the organization for them

Unfortunately, since I can't fork anymore at the moment, newer organizations are empty. I can't even fork my templates over to create projects.
