## Why blank organizations exist

This document goes over the reason why I currently operate blank organizations.

Unfortunately, since I can't fork anymore at the moment, newer organizations are empty (all organizations from 2022 April 15th or later) I can't even fork my templates over to create projects. Ever since an update on 2022 April 11th, the way projects can be forked changed significantly to a method that requires going to a page I have had issues with ever since reaching 200 organizations.

I can't fork at all on GitHub with the fork button. It just times out and gives a Unicorn (HTTP 502) error. The only way I can currently fork repositories is with my alt account, which I am avoiding usage in this way. I can still fork projects to my main account (excluding GitHub pages) by going to edit/create a file, which creates a fork. I then either navigate through the network, or replace the developer name with `seanpm2001`

I hope I can fix this issue in the future with automation, even if it gets fixed, I don't think I want to keep doing this manually.
