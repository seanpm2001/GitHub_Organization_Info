# GOI Docs

## Weekly process (2022)

A large list of organizations that needed to be made accumulated in late 2021. In early 2022, I started a project, where I would work on 10 organizations per day. The day I set is Friday.

I continued this project (and as of 2022, Saturday, May 21st) I am still going. The process started on 2022 February 5th (a Wednesday) it would later turn into a Friday project.

I have a ton of notes for this project that are still confidential until the project is complete enough. As of 2022, Saturday, May 21st, the notes are still not releasable.
