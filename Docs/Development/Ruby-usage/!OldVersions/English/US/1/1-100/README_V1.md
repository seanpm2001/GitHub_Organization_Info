# GOI Docs

## Ruby usage

This project uses Ruby for its framework, and for the GOI Maker program. At the moment, the Ruby source code is not functional.

A lot of notes were labeled as Ruby files, despite not needing to be in the language. Newer notes of this category are in ReStructuredText format.

Gemfiles are in use, but are not available yet. To fill the branch of the repository, there are 5 variants to every root Ruby file:

`Gemfile` - No extension

`Gemfile.rb`

`Gemfile.gem`

`Gemfile.rake`

`Gemfile.gemspec`

These extensions are also applied to the following files:

`Gemspec`

`Rakefile`

The only exception is these files:

`PROJECT_LANG_1.rb`

`SPM2001_GitHub_Organization_Info.gemspec`

This was done just because it can be done. Only 1 of the 5 are actually needed.
