## Keep alive

### Why is this repository still active?

New organizations have not been created since 2022 July, so why is this repository still being updated on a daily basis as of 2023, Wednesday, April 19th?

Here are my reasons for keeping this repository alive:

1. This is a **highly developed** repository, and I would like to keep it alive
2. **There is new data that is still coming in:** organization follow data (I could move it all to [:octocat: `GitHub FollowList`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/GitHub_FollowList/) but I feel that it is important to keep both repositories active, since they handle the data differently)
3. It isn't that hard to maintain this repository.
4. Occasionally, updates are made to the existing documentation and structure of this project.
5. No other reasons available at the moment.

### Notes

**Miscellaneous note:** I was going to write this document on 2023, Tuesday, April 18th, but GitHub was acting very off (it took over 6 minutes to push the 8th commit to this repository yesterday) and I decided to hold it off until GitHub was more stable.
