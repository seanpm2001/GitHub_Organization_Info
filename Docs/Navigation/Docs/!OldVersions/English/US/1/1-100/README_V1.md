# GOI Docs

## Navigation: Docs

[Docs](/Docs/) - This directory holds key documentation for the project. This markdown document assumes you are already in the docs, unless you moved the file.

The docs is separate from the Wiki. The docs are the place to start, the Wiki supplements it.

Why not merge the Wiki into the docs? I like having a Wiki.

**This document is incomplete. You can help by expanding it.**
