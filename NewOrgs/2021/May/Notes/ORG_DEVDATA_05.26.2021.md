# GitHub organization documentation process

**Legend:** an asterisk `*` before an entry indicates that it has been documented. Entries have been added at random, depending on what is left to document.

Not all entries are listed. Some were excluded, as they were done before the list was created and some were part of a daily schedule and weren't included. This file does not serve as a reference to all my GitHub organizations.

## Important note

Please, by all means, limit yourself to 16-17 new descriptions per day (10 of those are for the new descriptions) as you catch up. This is eating too much time. It takes over 3 hours to do 25, and you can be done by June 2nd or June 3rd 2021 if you do 16-17 per day. - An important note from your past self on May 25th 2021 (GitHub 1 year anniversary)

## NOTE FOR WRAPPING UP

If during the wrapping process of getting caught up documenting all organizations there are missing entries, please try these steps:

Search through the first 40 projects and see which ones don't exist
Search through the `seanpm2001` category
Use CTRL + F as much as you want
Give yourself time to find them
If you still really can't find them, raise an issue

Forgetting to document an organization isn't done out of laziness, or because I don't care about the organization, it is because it is very hard for one person to manage so many different projects (there are going to be at least 400 of them when done, right now (May 26th 2021) it stands at 282, with 10 being added daily, up to at least June 21st 2021)
