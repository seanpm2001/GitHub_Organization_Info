# New organizations May 2021

This month, I have been building a platform for my various projects through GitHub organizations, starting May 1st 2021, I have been creating 7 organizations per day. On May 10th 2021, I increased the production rate and went from 7 to 10 organizations a day, taking off 7-8 days of time. This is expected to continue until at least June 7th 2021, and possibly up to June 20th 2021 (at least 260 organizations will be made for this month at this point) (as of Wednesday, May 19th 2021 at 3:57 pm)
