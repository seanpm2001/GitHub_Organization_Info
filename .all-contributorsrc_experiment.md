# Planned experiments

## With the all-contributors bot

Can `all-contributors[bot]` list organizations as well as users? What happens if it exceeds 1000 entries?

This task is so massive that it is going to have to be automated if it is ever attempted. I cannot do all this by hand.

### March 6th later data

Yes, the `all-contributors[bot]` can list organization as well as users. It may also help index some other data (the linked entry for the organization)

### March 7th data

I didn't go further with this today, the task is going to have to be automated for the other 809 existing `SEANPM2001` organizations, and future ones.

Things to account for (with the [`AUTOMATE2001`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/AUTOMATE-2001/) bot):

- > README modifications and archival

- > Profile picture attribution

- > JSON data

- > HTML data

- > Existing data

- > Keeping it up to date
