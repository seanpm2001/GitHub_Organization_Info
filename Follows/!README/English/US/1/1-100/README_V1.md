# Following organizations

GitHub finally added the ability to follow organizations on 2022 March 21st, and it seems I can follow the organizations I make. I realize I have to document this as well now.

This feature has been highly requested for years, I have been wanting it since 2020. It got added on my 21st birthday, which I will consider as a birthday present.

Organization follow data is in the URLL file format. It is essentially a URL list file. It is a plain text format. You can learn more about it here:
