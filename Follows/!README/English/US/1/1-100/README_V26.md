GitHub finally added the ability to follow organizations on 2022 March 21st, and it seems I can follow the organizations I make. I realize I have to document this as well now.

This feature has been highly requested for years, I have been wanting it since 2020. It got added on my 21st birthday, which I will consider as a birthday present.

Organization follow data is in the URLL file format. It is essentially a URL list file. It is a plain text format. You can learn more about it here:

- [`URLL Specification on GitHub`](https://github.com/URLL-Specification/) [**Disclaimer:** This project is also run by [`@seanpm2001`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/)]

The file has been upgraded on 2022 March 22nd from URLL version 1 to URLL version 2. Included changes include a Shebang, and comments

```elm
-- This is what a comment looks
```

```elm
--URLL-version=2;
-- This is what a shebang looks like
```

Elm syntax highlighting is being used in place of URLL syntax highlighting, as the language isn't notable enough to be recognized by GitHub yet.

**Day 1**

GitHub finally added the ability to follow organizations on 2022 March 21st, and it seems I can follow the organizations I make. I realize I have to document this as well now.

I didn't make much use of the feature yet today, only following a few organizations as a test. This update fell right on my 21st birthday, which I count as an extra birthday present.

**Day 2**

I continued to follow organizations today. I of course am following other organizations as well. Today, I went on a follow-spree, and followed nearly 100 organizations. It is something I am going to have to keep up with. I have over 800 to go.

**Day 3**

I am now setting the limit on myself to follow a maximum of 100 organizations and users. I don't want to jump up by more than 0.1k following per day. I also am going to work on limiting the amount I follow per day, likely to 90-95, until I am caught up. THis process should take another 7-9 days at the current rate, then it will die down. I followed exactly 100 organizations today.

I am still awaiting the feature to separate followed users from followed organizations.

**Day 4**

I finished following the 100 organizations pretty quickly today, it is something I enjoyed doing, but got through really fast. I hope to increase the diversity of my follows after a large enough majority of my own organizations are followed. I also forgot about the rule to leave space for follow for follows/other follows today.

The ratio was 99:1 (only 1 external organization was followed)

**Day 5**

I continued following organizations today. I followed the 10 new organizations I created today as well, between part 3 and 4 of the screenshot documentation process (appearing on the final screenshot set for each organization) I followed some other ones of mine that I had laid out, but today, I went through a list of other organizations. The ones not owned by me were followed in majority today. Since I did 2 follow for follow actions today, I could only follow 98 organizations, instead of the full 100.

The ratio today was 18:80(98:2)

**Day 6**

I worked on following 100 organizations again today. I was going through the list of organizations I have wrote down in my activity logs. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to finish the list today, there were less than 15 entries left that I couldn't get to. Additionally, I accidentally followed 101 organizations, instead of 100. I also wanted to throw in some diversity and put in 2 of my own organizations. This project will still take some time before I am caught up. I likely won't create only 99 entries tomorrow, I will still go for 100. I left no room for follow for follow actions today.

One of the organizations on my list no longer exists. It couldn't be followed or interacted with for that reason.

The ratio for today was 99:2

**Day 7**

I followed 99 organizations today, not 100 or more. I didn't follow 100, as I had to do a follow for follow action today. It is really difficult to navigate the list, I feel it is going to end up worse than the GitHub Organization Info documentation process, as I started much later on. I feel like there might be more than 2 missing entries when I get "caught up"

This project will continue daily for at least 5 more days.
 
The ratio for today was 88:11(99:1)

**Day 9**

I continued for a 9th day today, following 98 organizations and following 2 users (follow for follow) this project will continue daily for at least 4 more days (no change from yesterday, as more entries are being determined)

I am hoping for a day where I can follow 100 of my own organizations, but I keep running into F4F requirements, or new interesting projects.

The ratio for today was 95:3(98:2)
