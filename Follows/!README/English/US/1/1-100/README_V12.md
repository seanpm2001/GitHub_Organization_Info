GitHub finally added the ability to follow organizations on 2022 March 21st, and it seems I can follow the organizations I make. I realize I have to document this as well now.

This feature has been highly requested for years, I have been wanting it since 2020. It got added on my 21st birthday, which I will consider as a birthday present.

Organization follow data is in the URLL file format. It is essentially a URL list file. It is a plain text format. You can learn more about it here:

- [`URLL Specification on GitHub`](https://github.com/URLL-Specification/) [**Disclaimer:** This project is also run by [`@seanpm2001`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/)]

The file has been upgraded on 2022 March 22nd from URLL version 1 to URLL version 2. Included changes include a Shebang, and comments

```elm
-- This is what a comment looks
```

```elm
--URLL-version=2;
-- This is what a shebang looks like
```

Elm syntax highlighting is being used in place of URLL syntax highlighting, as the language isn't notable enough to be recognized by GitHub yet.
