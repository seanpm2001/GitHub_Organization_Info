# Following organizations

<details open><summary><p lang="en"><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse the lead section</b></p></summary>

GitHub finally added the ability to follow organizations on 2022 March 21st, and it seems I can follow the organizations I make. I realize I have to document this as well now.

This feature has been highly requested for years, I have been wanting it since 2020. It got added on my 21st birthday, which I will consider as a birthday present.

Organization follow data is in the URLL file format. It is essentially a URL list file. It is a plain text format. You can learn more about it here:

- [`URLL Specification on GitHub`](https://github.com/URLL-Specification/) [**Disclaimer:** This project is also run by [`@seanpm2001`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/)]

The file has been upgraded on 2022 March 22nd from URLL version 1 to URLL version 2. Included changes include a Shebang, and comments

```elm
-- This is what a comment looks
```

```elm
--URLL-version=2;
-- This is what a shebang looks like
```

Elm syntax highlighting is being used in place of URLL syntax highlighting, as the language isn't notable enough to be recognized by GitHub yet.

I continued to follow organizations today. I of course am following other organizations as well. Today, I went on a follow-spree, and followed nearly 100 organizations. It is something I am going to have to keep up with. I have over 800 to go.

##### 2022 March 23rd

I am now setting the limit on myself to follow a maximum of 100 organizations and users. I don't want to jump up by more than 0.1k following per day. I also am going to work on limiting the amount I follow per day, likely to 90-95, until I am caught up. THis process should take another 7-9 days at the current rate, then it will die down. I followed exactly 100 organizations today.

I am still awaiting the feature to separate followed users from followed organizations.

The compilation file contains a link of every organization I have ever followed. It is split into 2 sections: a full compilation, and a compilation sorted by which day I followed which organization.
