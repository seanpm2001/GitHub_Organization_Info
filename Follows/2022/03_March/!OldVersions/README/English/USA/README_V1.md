# Organization Follows

## 2022 March

### No data

( [`<<< 2022 February`](/Follows/2022/02_February/) | **2022: 03: March** | [`2022 April >>>`](/Follows/2022/04_April/) )

The ability to follow organizations wasn't made available until 2022, Monday, March 21st. For that reason, there is no for half of this month.

Additionally, the naming scheme used for this `README.md` file is not present in the original follow log, which I hope to maintain separately. For the original directory, see [`March`](/Follows/2022/March/)

If you want to see other GitHub follow data from me, see [`GitHub_FollowList`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/GitHub_FollowList/)
