# GitHub Organization Follows

## 2022 Data

The ability to follow organizations wasn't made available until 2022, Monday, March 21st. For that reason, there is no data from 2022 January 1st to 2022 March 20th. There still is data from 2022 March 21st to 2022 December 31st.

### Non-standard

These months were created outside the `##_Month` pattern, and are the original directories of the project. They have been duplicated into the standard directories, but still exist here in their original form:

* [`March`](/Follows/2022/March/)
* [`April`](/Follows/2022/April/)
