# Organization Follows

## 2020 May

### No data

( [`<<< 2020 April`](/Follows/2020/04_April/) | **2020: 05: May** | [`2020 June >>>`](/Follows/2020/06_June/) )

My GitHub account wasn't created until 2020, May 25th. Additionally, the ability to follow organizations wasn't made available until 2022, Monday, March 21st. Even for May 25th and onward, I still wouldn't be able to follow organizations. For that reason, there is no data here.

If you want to see other GitHub follow data from me, see [`GitHub_FollowList`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/GitHub_FollowList/)
