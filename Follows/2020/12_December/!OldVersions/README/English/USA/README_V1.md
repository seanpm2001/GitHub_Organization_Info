# Organization Follows

## 2020 December

### No data

( [`<<< 2020 November`](/Follows/2020/11_November/) | **2020: 12: December** | [`2021 January >>>`](/Follows/2021/01_January/) )

The ability to follow organizations wasn't made available until 2022, Monday, March 21st. For that reason, there is no data here.

If you want to see other GitHub follow data from me, see [`GitHub_FollowList`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/GitHub_FollowList/)
