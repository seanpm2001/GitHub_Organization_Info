# Organization Follows

## 2020 August

### No data

( [`<<< 2020 July`](/Follows/2020/07_July/) | **2020: 08: August** | [`2020 September >>>`](/Follows/2020/09_September/) )

The ability to follow organizations wasn't made available until 2022, Monday, March 21st. For that reason, there is no data here.

If you want to see other GitHub follow data from me, see [`GitHub_FollowList`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/GitHub_FollowList/)
