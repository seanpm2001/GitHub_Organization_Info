//// ORG_FOLLOWS_2026.01.04
//// GitHub Organizations followed by @seanpm2001 (On 2026, Sunday, January 4th)

//// A little context
//// I am gathering URLs en masse for forking,
//// and I am going down an exponentiating rabbithole that
//// only gets deeper the more I go through it. I originally
//// started with just a few organizations, then when I cut 34
//// out (like on 2023, Saturday, January 28th) an additional 20+
//// got added, now totaling over 100 in my queue. I am still
//// trying to figure out where the stopping point is for this
//// project, it is using 1-2 hours of time per day, and has been
//// going for about 5 days now (as of 2023, Saturday, January 28th
//// at 5:33 pm PST) as of this date, I have gathered over 4000
//// repository URLs from over 70 different organizations.
//// This has been mostly paused since 2023 February, but there has been
//// on and off activity since.
////
//// I have recently quadrupled the amount of daily forks allowed
//// bringing it from 17-25 to 92-100, as I have been going through
//// my queue too slowly, and it would have taken until late 2025 to get
//// it done at the previous rate.
////
//// Starting in the last quarter of 2024, I began to document organizations
//// differently, not gathering all of the repositories related to a fork
//// of a repository in an organization, but just the organization source
//// repositories. As of 2024, December 1st, I have gathered enough repository
//// URLs to last me at a rate of 43 per day (up to 2025, March 7th) and at a
//// rate of 18 per day up to late October of 2025

//// Follows from today (0)
//// As of: 2026, Sunday, January 4th

//// No new organizations were followed today. This is a filler entry.

//// Total: 0

//// Template
//// No new organizations were followed today. This is a filler entry.

//// Cannot follow (organizations) (1)
//// As of: 2026, Sunday, January 4th

//// This is the second account I have come across on GitHub to date, where attempting to follow the account, or star/watch any of its repositories results in the action being denied, with the message "You can't perform that action at this time"

https://github.com/fish-shell

//// Other unfollowable accounts (non-organization) (1)

//// This is the first account I have come across on GitHub to date, where attempting to follow the account, or star/watch any of its repositories results in the action being denied, with the message "You can't perform that action at this time"

//// Queue (199)
//// As of: 2026, Sunday, January 4th

//// Too many repositories per organization, and the forks most often lead me to
//// discover another organization or set of organizations, causing a hydra effect.
//// This queue is currently frozen for this reason (as of 2023, Friday, July 28th)
//// Notable languages discovered during this process include:
//// KiCad Layout, Dataweave, RAML, CUE, Cairo (and at least 25 others)

//// Followed, but still of interest (logging check needed) (196)
//// As of: 2026, Sunday, January 4th

//// Higher priority (40)
//// As of: 2026, Sunday, January 4th

//// Higher priority, as these good organizations, or are of significance to me

//// "r" after a number stands for "repositories"

//// These repository counts are constantly changing, and will not be fully

//// major sorting project.
//// The repositories are in order by repository count.
