# Bulk Create notes

## 2022 April 22nd

Lately, GitHub asks me to confirm my password for entering `sudo` mode before creating each organization. This week, it only did it the first 7 times, then it stopped. This is why there are 3 less images for the `bulk_create` directory when compared to last week.
