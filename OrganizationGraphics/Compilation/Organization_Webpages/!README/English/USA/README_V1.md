# Compilation mode

## Organization Webpages

This directory houses my organization webpage screenshots in compilation format (instead of by year and by month) 2 variants are available.

- [Foldered](/OrganizationGraphics/Compilation/Organization_Webpages/Foldered/) - Contains all the organization pictures tidied up in folders.
- [Unfoldered](/OrganizationGraphics/Compilation/Organization_Webpages/Unfoldered/) - Contains all the organization pictures without their folders

There is so much data that as of 2022 June 12th, `Unfoldered` is truncated on GitHub, and you can't view over 2000 of the files without downloading the repository. `Foldered` might be the same way in the future.
