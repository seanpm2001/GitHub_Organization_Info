This is as much as I am willing to do today. This project will likely take a couple/a few more days to catch up on. - 2021 Saturday October 9th

This is a long and tedious process. It may take me several more days. I didn't have as much time for it today to prevent burnout. - 2021 Sunday October 10th

This is still a long and tedious process. It is going to take me several more days to finish. I made a lot more progress today, I am nearing the halfway point. I had to stop early today, as I got burnt out, and I also need to fix my schedule. - 2021 Monday October 11th

This is still a long process. I am past the halfway point now. I could have done more today, but I got distracted, and also need to continue working on fixing my schedule. - 2021 Tuesday October 12th

I made lots of progress today, and I am expected to complete the process tomorrow. I have 36 status posts left to make (72 files when counting archives, 74 when counting tomorrows 2021 October 14th post) I would have just finished up today, but I wanted to save it for tomorrow. - 2021 Wednesday October 13th

I finally finished the project today. I am all caught up. I have 4 organizations to make, so that is what I will be doing next. I won't be making the 2021 October 14th status post until later. - 2021 Thursday Octlober 14th
