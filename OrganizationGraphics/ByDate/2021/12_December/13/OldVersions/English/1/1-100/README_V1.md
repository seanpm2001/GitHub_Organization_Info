## No data 🚫

No new organizations were created on 2021 December 13th There is no new data here.

I will (hopefully) be creating new organizations at some point later this month. At the moment, I have become overloaded, and need to take a break. The list keeps growing faster than I can catch up on it, and it would have taken 3+ more consecutive days of work, which I can't do right now.
