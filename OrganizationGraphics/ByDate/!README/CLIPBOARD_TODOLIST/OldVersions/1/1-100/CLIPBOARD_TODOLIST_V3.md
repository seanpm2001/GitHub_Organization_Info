This is as much as I am willing to do today. This project will likely take a couple/a few more days to catch up on. - 2021 Saturday October 9th

This is a long and tedious process. It may take me several more days. I didn't have as much time for it today to prevent burnout. - 2021 Sunday October 10th

This is still a long and tedious process. It is going to take me several more days to finish. I made a lot more progress today, I am nearing the halfway point. I had to stop early today, as I got burnt out, and I also need to fix my schedule. - 2021 Monday October 11th
