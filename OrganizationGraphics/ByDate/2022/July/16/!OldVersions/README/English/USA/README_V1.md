# 2022 July 16th üìÖ

## No data üö´

<details open><summary><p lang="en"><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section</b></p></summary>

No new organizations were created on 2022, Saturday, July 16th. There is no new data here.

<!-- I do not plan on creating any new organizations until I get more caught up, and have at least 6 hours of free time on any day (most likely, I will resume next Friday, March 4th) !-->

I am now working off a weekly schedule, set to Friday of each week. I won't resume again until 2022, Friday, July 22nd. I hope to finish within the next 12 consecutive weeks, although the workload keeps going up, so I am just trying to get through each week, and hope no more than 9 entries get added per week (I limit myself to 10 per week for time and display reasons, as it already takes 6+ hours for 10, and GitHub wouldn't show an 11th daily entry on my daily activity counter)

I have recently begun to prepare Firefox profiles beforehand (before Friday) this helps save 1-2+ hours of time. However, from 2022 May 5th to May 18th, I have stopped doing this. I started preparing early again on 2022, May 19th, but did not do so for the 2022 May 27th entries, but then did so again for the June 3rd session, but only partially did so for the 2022 June 10th session. I did it in full for the 2022 June 17th session, 2022 June 24th, 2022 July 1st, 2022 July 8th, and 2022 July 15th sessions.

<!-- I will (hopefully) be creating new organizations at some point later this month. At the moment, I have become overloaded, and need to take a break. The list keeps growing faster than I can catch up on it, and it would have taken 3+ more consecutive days of work, which I can't do right now. !-->

This Friday (2022, July 22nd) is going to be different again, as I cannot fork repositories at the moment (all attempts to fork a repository ever since Monday, April 11th have resulted in a Unicorn error) and since I require forking projects to an organization to set it up, one step will have to be skipped again this week if the feature isn't added back by 2022, Friday, July 22nd at 12:00 pm PST. This will result in this weeks organizations being created as blanks. I have already reconfigured my todo list so that it is partially compatible with this change. I am developing a long list of projects to fork, when it gets added back, it is going to take a lot of time to get caught back up. I am hoping to automate it now, instead of wait for it to be added back.

### Research notes

<details open><summary><p lang="en"><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section</b></p></summary>

I did some experimentation with this issue on the Sage language profile from last week. I found that before refreshing, I was still capable of pressing the `fork` button and getting a list of repositories to fork to. After refreshing, the update kicked in, and it went back to taking a long time to load before giving a Unicorn error. So something DID break on GitHub on 2022, Monday, April 11th.

I also tested on my alt account. Since it is only part of 1 organization, it let me in. The update seems to have merged the create a repository from a template, and fork a repository pages together, the first one is extremely inefficient, and hasn't worked for me for over 5 months. That means that fixing it on my main is out of my reach, and I will have to wait for Microsoft to fix this (if they ever do that)

I have a backup plan, which is to join less than 100 organizations with my alt account, and continue to do forks that way. However, I don't want the forks to apply to that account, and I have so many to go through that it would require multiple alt accounts, which I also can't do.

Unfortunately, even with the possible fixes, I can't fork a repository to my main account anymore either, and that can't be done with an alt account as well.

Unfortunately, this issue is not easy to fix. I am considering using a third party to do forks, but I don't know if this will work with my needs.

**Edit on 2022, Friday, April 15th**

When I originally wrote the description for today, I forgot to list 2 important things I tried:

* Disabling JavaScript (uBlock Origin)

This did not help with the problem at all, but I did learn that GitHub can function surprisingly well without JavaScript.

* Preventing images from loading (uBlock Origin)

I prevented some images from loading, but not all the ones I wanted to block. This method did not help with the problem at all either, as I wasn't able to block profile pictures, or media included in `README` files.

**Edit on 2022, Sunday, April 17th**

This isn't going to be a problem. I can automate this task, and save myself several hours of time per week. I have gotten a list of forks ready, I just need to work on my automation scripting in AUTOMATE2001 or GitHubby.

**Edit on 2022, Tuesday, April 26th**

I thought of and successfully tested a basic workaround for this problem, which is:

To fork to my own account:

1. Go to the desired repository

2. Go into edit mode on any file

3. Stop editing the file, as a fork has been successfully made

This is a start, but it won't help at all for the organization part of things. I still intend to automate this task.
