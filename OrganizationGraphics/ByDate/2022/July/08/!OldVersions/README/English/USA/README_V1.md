# 2022, Friday, July 8th üìÖ

<details open><summary><p lang="en"><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section</b></p></summary>

I resumed work on organization creation today, I am pretty backed up on it, and continued working on the list.

It will take me a minimum of 11-12 more workdays to get caught up, and they likely won't all be consecutive. The number isn't changing, as the entry count is still going up. At the current rate, I will finish on 2022, Friday, September 30th. I will return again on 2022, Friday, July 15th.

I had less to do today, as I had the time last night to prepare profiles early. Also, I couldn't fork repositories due to a GitHub update on 2022, Monday, April 11th, although I went slower, since I was working on a new device, and because it took GitHub over 1-2 minutes to load the organization profile picture each time, even though it was already loaded everywhere else.

This was week 23. I am currently scheduled to go to week 34, but the entry count keeps going up, so the week count is going to go up as well. <!-- It is going up much slower now, and hasn't gone up very much in the past week. !-->
