## No data 🚫

<details open><summary><p lang="en"><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section</b></p></summary>

No new organizations were created by me on 2022, Sunday, November 27th. There is no new data here. It is expected that no more organizations will be created by me on GitHub.

On 2022, Tuesday, July 19th, my account was flagged for unknown reasons. I am hoping to have it recovered as soon as possible. As of 2022 Sunday, August 21st (day 34) it is still flagged, but I did receive a response on 2022 Wednesday, August 3rd at 11:57 am. I am now going to have to delete all of my organizations from GitHub and stop creating them here. I will now be creating them on a private server, instead of GitHub. This project has been suspended, but data will still be added here. I have released the notes for the year, as I don't plan to continue creating organizations.

A daily message will be written here, and the follows directory will still be updated. This is a huge loss for me, and it isn't going to be easy at all for me.

### 2022 August 4th

GitHub is currently refusing to let me delete my organizations, and is even refusing to delete my organizations themselves. This is a tricky situation for getting my account back.

### 2022 August 5th

I went back and checked, after I sent them the message to delete all of my organizations, they secretly unlocked the delete button. It looks like this is going to have to be done manually, which will take a while. I am doing final documentation on the organizations before each delete, this will take more time as I get closer to the top of the list, where complexity increases.

**Deletion log notes:**

**Daily log:**

**Day 0:** _I received the instruction to delete organizations, I tried doing it automatically, which failed, so I planned to start doing it manually the next day._

**Day 1:** _The 140 organizations deleted today don't have in-depth screenshots, as the organizations were empty, and already had screenshot documentation of themselves._

**Day 2:** _80 organizations were deleted today, in-depth screenshots started today as well._

**Day 3:** _I had a difficult time today, and was only able to delete 60 organizations._

**Day 4:** _I now plan to delete 80 organizations per day consistently until I finish deleting all of them._

**Day 5:** _I continued with the plan of deleting 80 per day today. `seanpm2001-all` and `seanwallawalla-forks` were deleted, but still persist on my profile, despite the fact that any user (even me) that visits them gets a 404 error._

**Day 6:** _I accidentally deleted 1 extra organization today._

**Day 7:** _I deleted 79 organizations today, instead of 80, to even out yesterdays mistake. I will continue to delete organizations 80 at a time tomorrow._

**Day 8:** _I went back to deleting 80 organizations per day today. I expect to finish in 4 days. Today, I also have noted that my "what's left" screenshot contains an error (Firefox has been wrapping my username across a whole line of the list) it is possible to be fixed in the future with data and image manipulation._

**Day 9:** _I suffered significant losses today, some of my most important organizations had to be deleted. There were some really special ones today._

**Day 10:** _I finished deleting all non-SNU organizations today. My 'What's left' screenshot also contained no errors today, as the image wasn't wrapped due to how small the selection was._ _Seanpm2001-Ubuntu was deleted today after several linked snaps were no longer available, thus they did not show up in the documentation. It is possible to recreate this data - 2022 August 14th_

**Day 11:** _Only SNU organizations are left, and they all have the same icon. Tomorrow will be the last day of this project._

**Day 12:** _I deleted the last 80 organizations today, which were all SNU organizations. During the last 22 entries, GitHub was deleting organizations by the time I got back to my profile from going back 3 pages, normally, I would have to reload the page first. The project is now complete, and I am contemplating what to do next to try and get my account back. The organization list would be empty if `seanpm2001-all` and `seanwallawalla-forks` would have gone away, but they have persisted for 7 days now._

**Day 13:** _The project was completed yesterday. No data is available to delete. Although, I now notice that the option to `switch to another account` is gone. `seanpm2001-all` and `seanwallawalla-forks` have still not gone away, they have persisted for 8 days now._

**Day 14:** _No data for today, the `seanpm2001-all` and `seanwallawalla-forks` organizations have still not gone away, persisting for 9 days now. I worry it might interfere with my appeal._

**Day 15:** _No data for today, the `seanpm2001-all` and `seanwallawalla-forks` organizations have still not gone away, persisting for 10 days now. I worry it might interfere with my appeal. I sent an appeal tonight._

**Day 16:** _No data for today, although I updated the table to make some enhancements, and fix a spelling error in the title. The `seanpm2001-all` and `seanwallawalla-forks` organizations have still not gone away, persisting for 11 days now. I worry it might interfere with my appeal that was sent last night._

**Additional log:**

The organizations `Seanpm2001-all` and `seanwallawalla-forks` were deleted on 2022, Thursday, August 9th. As of 2022, Sunday, August 14th, they still appear on my profile, despite being completely deleted, with no way for me or anyone else to access them (you just get a 404 page) it has been over 120 hours.

On 2022 Monday, August 8th, I decided to set the amount of orgs deleted per day to 80 (8x8=64) so that I can have a consistent and measured reduction in just 8 days. I expect to finish on 2022, Tuesday, August 16th. If things don't go as planned, it may take longer.

I updated my second account ([`@seanwallawalla`](https://github.com/seanwallawalla/)) on 2022 August 9th, removing the reference to `seanwallawalla-software` and changing the location to match my main account.

I began getting screenshots of the rendered markdown table on 2022, August 15th.

Despite no data before 2022 August 5th, and after August 16th, I still really felt like updating the table to reflect these days.

### 2022 August 19th

Tonight, I sent a 3rd appeal to GitHub. I have yet to receive a response. - 2022, August 19th

### 2022 August 20th to 2022 August 25th

I am waiting for a response to my 3rd appeal to GitHub. I have not yet received a response. - 2022, Saturday, August 20th to 2022, Thursday, August 25th

### 2022, Friday, August 26th to 2022 November 27th

My account was finally restored today. I would be much happier about this and have had a better day if it wasn't for my laptop showing signs of hardware failure, and constantly crashing (plus my first kernel panic) it hasn't crashed in nearly 8 hours. I hope I have resolved the issue somewhat. I am still really glad to have my account back. Again, thank you GitHub! - 2022, Friday, August 26th

My account was still restored today. - 2022, Saturday, August 27th to 2022, Sunday, November 27th

- Restored for `094` days (last checked on 2022, Wednesday, September 7th [`with this link`](https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&q=Days+since+August+26th+2022&ia=answer)) (note: time zone difference, DuckDuckGo does not use Pacific Daylight Time, it seems to be using Eastern Time Zone)

**Why this detailed log message is still here:** This message goes over an important part of my history on GitHub, and goes over the major organization issue I had. It is kept for historical significance, and as a reference.

### Research notes

<details open><summary><p lang="en"><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section</b></p></summary>

I did some experimentation with this issue on the Sage language profile from last week. I found that before refreshing, I was still capable of pressing the `fork` button and getting a list of repositories to fork to. After refreshing, the update kicked in, and it went back to taking a long time to load before giving a Unicorn error. So something DID break on GitHub on 2022, Monday, April 11th.

I also tested on my alt account. Since it is only part of 1 organization, it let me in. The update seems to have merged the create a repository from a template, and fork a repository pages together, the first one is extremely inefficient, and hasn't worked for me for over 5 months. That means that fixing it on my main is out of my reach, and I will have to wait for Microsoft to fix this (if they ever do that)

I have a backup plan, which is to join less than 100 organizations with my alt account, and continue to do forks that way. However, I don't want the forks to apply to that account, and I have so many to go through that it would require multiple alt accounts, which I also can't do.

Unfortunately, even with the possible fixes, I can't fork a repository to my main account anymore either, and that can't be done with an alt account as well.

Unfortunately, this issue is not easy to fix. I am considering using a third party to do forks, but I don't know if this will work with my needs.

**Edit on 2022, Friday, April 15th**

When I originally wrote the description for today, I forgot to list 2 important things I tried:

* Disabling JavaScript (uBlock Origin)

This did not help with the problem at all, but I did learn that GitHub can function surprisingly well without JavaScript.

* Preventing images from loading (uBlock Origin)

I prevented some images from loading, but not all the ones I wanted to block. This method did not help with the problem at all either, as I wasn't able to block profile pictures, or media included in `README` files.

**Edit on 2022, Sunday, April 17th**

This isn't going to be a problem. I can automate this task, and save myself several hours of time per week. I have gotten a list of forks ready, I just need to work on my automation scripting in AUTOMATE2001 or GitHubby.

**Edit on 2022, Tuesday, April 26th**

I thought of and successfully tested a basic workaround for this problem, which is:

To fork to my own account:

1. Go to the desired repository

2. Go into edit mode on any file

3. Stop editing the file, as a fork has been successfully made

This is a start, but it won't help at all for the organization part of things. I still intend to automate this task.
