<details open><summary><p lang="en"><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section</b></p></summary>

I resumed work on organization creation today, I am pretty backed up on it, and continued working on the list.

It will take me a minimum of 12-13 more workdays to get caught up, and they likely won't all be consecutive. The number isn't changing, as the entry count is still going up. At the current rate, I will finish on 2022, Friday, August 5th.

I had more to do today, as I forgot to create profiles beforehand and ran out of time when I remembered at 11:00 pm last night. I thought it was going to significantly add to the time today, but it ended up taking less than an extra hour. Also, I couldn't fork repositories due to a GitHub update on 2022, Monday, April 11th, this was a major contributor to this speedy finish.

This was week 14. I am currently scheduled to go to week 27, but the entry count keeps going up, so the week count is going to go up as well.
