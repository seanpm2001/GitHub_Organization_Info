I resumed work on organization creation today, I am pretty backed up on it, and continued working on the list.

It will take me a minimum of 13-14 more workdays to get caught up, and they likely won't all be consecutive. <!-- The number isn't changing, as the entry count is still going up. !--> At the current rate, I will finish on 2022, Friday, September 2nd.

I had more to do today, as I didn't have the time last night to prepare profiles early. Also, I couldn't fork repositories due to a GitHub update on 2022, Monday, April 11th, this was a major contributor to this speedy finish.

This was week 17. I am currently scheduled to go to week 30, but the entry count keeps going up, so the week count is going to go up as well. Unfortunately, it jumped recently, 3 weeks were added in 1 day. <!-- It is going up much slower now, and has stayed the same compared to last week. !-->
