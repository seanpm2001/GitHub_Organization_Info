# 2022 May 20th üìÖ

<details open><summary><p lang="en"><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section</b></p></summary>

I resumed work on organization creation today, I am pretty backed up on it, and continued working on the list.

It will take me a minimum of 11-12 more workdays to get caught up, and they likely won't all be consecutive. <!-- The number isn't changing, as the entry count is still going up. !--> At the current rate, I will finish on 2022, Friday, August 5th.

I had less to do today, as I created 9 out of 10 profiles beforehand (forgetting about 360Desktop until I was about 70% done) Also, I couldn't fork repositories due to a GitHub update on 2022, Monday, April 11th, this was a major contributor to this speedy finish.

This was week 16. I am currently scheduled to go to week 27, but the entry count keeps going up, so the week count is going to go up as well. It is going up much slower now, and has stayed the same compared to last week.
