# 2022 February 17th 📅

## No data 🚫

No new organizations were created on 2022 February 17th There is no new data here.

<!-- I do not plan on creating any new organizations until I get more caught up, and until I have more time. This rules out Saturday and Sunday, and almost fully rules out Friday, as it was really difficult last time I did this on that day. I will most likely return to do at least 1 more batch this month, I am uncertain when though. !-->

If everything works out, I should be able to resume tomorrow. I hope to be able to do it more than once a week, so that I can get caught up and stay caught up.

<!-- I will (hopefully) be creating new organizations at some point later this month. At the moment, I have become overloaded, and need to take a break. The list keeps growing faster than I can catch up on it, and it would have taken 3+ more consecutive days of work, which I can't do right now. !-->
