# 2022 February 11th üìÖ

I resumed work on organization creation today, I am pretty backed up on it, and started working on the list. It will take me a minimum of 9 more workdays tp get caught up, and they likely won't all be consecutive.

<!-- I will (hopefully) be creating new organizations at some point later this month. At the moment, I have become overloaded, and need to take a break. The list keeps growing faster than I can catch up on it, and it would have taken 3+ more consecutive days of work, which I can't do right now. !-->
