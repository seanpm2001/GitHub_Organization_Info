# 2022 March 18th üìÖ

I resumed work on organization creation today, I am pretty backed up on it, and continued working on the list. It will take me a minimum of 8-9 more workdays to get caught up, and they likely won't all be consecutive. Today, I completed all creation work in less than 3 hours, far quicker than expected.
