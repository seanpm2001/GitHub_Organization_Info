## No data 🚫

<details open><summary><p lang="en"><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section</b></p></summary>

No new organizations were created on 2022, Monday, August 8th. There is no new data here.

On 2022, Tuesday, July 19th, my account was flagged for unknown reasons. I am hoping to have it recovered as soon as possible. As of 2022 Sunday, August 8th (day 21) it is still flagged, but I did receive a response on 2022 Wednesday, August 3rd at 11:57 am. I am now going to have to delete all of my organizations from GitHub and stop creating them here. I will now be creating them on a private server, instead of GitHub. This project has been suspended, but data will still be added here. I have released the notes for the year, as I don't plan to continue creating organizations.

A daily message will be written here, and the follows directory will still be updated. This is a huge loss for me, and it isn't going to be easy at all for me.

GitHub is currently refusing to let me delete my organizations, and is even refusing to delete my organizations themselves. This is a tricky situation for getting my account back.

I went back and checked, after I sent them the message to delete all of my organizations, they secretly unlocked the delete button. It looks like this is going to have to be done manually, which will take a while. I am doing final documentation on the organizations before each delete, this will take more time as I get closer to the top of the list, where complexity increases.

| Date | # of Organizations deleted today | # of organizations deleted total | Percentage of total |  Total % |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Day 1, 2022, Friday, August 5th | 140 | 140 | 14.0% | 14.0% |
| Day 2, 2022, Saturday, August 6th | 80 | 220 | 08.0% | 22.0% |
| Day 3, 2022, Sunday, August 7th | 60 | 280 | 06.0% | 28.0% |
| Day 4, 2022, Monday, August 8th | 80 | 360 | 08.0% | 36.0% |
| Day 5, Coming soon | :x: | :x: | :x: | :x: |

### Research notes

<details open><summary><p lang="en"><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section</b></p></summary>

I did some experimentation with this issue on the Sage language profile from last week. I found that before refreshing, I was still capable of pressing the `fork` button and getting a list of repositories to fork to. After refreshing, the update kicked in, and it went back to taking a long time to load before giving a Unicorn error. So something DID break on GitHub on 2022, Monday, April 11th.

I also tested on my alt account. Since it is only part of 1 organization, it let me in. The update seems to have merged the create a repository from a template, and fork a repository pages together, the first one is extremely inefficient, and hasn't worked for me for over 5 months. That means that fixing it on my main is out of my reach, and I will have to wait for Microsoft to fix this (if they ever do that)

I have a backup plan, which is to join less than 100 organizations with my alt account, and continue to do forks that way. However, I don't want the forks to apply to that account, and I have so many to go through that it would require multiple alt accounts, which I also can't do.

Unfortunately, even with the possible fixes, I can't fork a repository to my main account anymore either, and that can't be done with an alt account as well.

Unfortunately, this issue is not easy to fix. I am considering using a third party to do forks, but I don't know if this will work with my needs.

**Edit on 2022, Friday, April 15th**

When I originally wrote the description for today, I forgot to list 2 important things I tried:

* Disabling JavaScript (uBlock Origin)

This did not help with the problem at all, but I did learn that GitHub can function surprisingly well without JavaScript.

* Preventing images from loading (uBlock Origin)

I prevented some images from loading, but not all the ones I wanted to block. This method did not help with the problem at all either, as I wasn't able to block profile pictures, or media included in `README` files.

**Edit on 2022, Sunday, April 17th**

This isn't going to be a problem. I can automate this task, and save myself several hours of time per week. I have gotten a list of forks ready, I just need to work on my automation scripting in AUTOMATE2001 or GitHubby.

**Edit on 2022, Tuesday, April 26th**

I thought of and successfully tested a basic workaround for this problem, which is:

To fork to my own account:

1. Go to the desired repository

2. Go into edit mode on any file

3. Stop editing the file, as a fork has been successfully made

This is a start, but it won't help at all for the organization part of things. I still intend to automate this task.
