# 2022 August 4th üìÖ

## No data üö´

<details open><summary><p lang="en"><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section</b></p></summary>

No new organizations were created on 2022, Thursday, August 4th. There is no new data here.

On 2022, Tuesday, July 19th, my account was flagged for unknown reasons. I am hoping to have it recovered as soon as possible. As of 2022, Thursday, August 4th (day 17) it is still flagged, but I did receive a response last night. I am now going to have to delete all of my organizations from GitHub and stop creating them here. I will now be creating them on a private server, instead of GitHub. This project has been suspended, but data will still be added here. I am still deciding on whether I should release my notes or not.

A daily message will be written here, and the follows directory will still be updated. This is a huge loss for me, and it isn't going to be easy at all for me.

### Research notes

<details open><summary><p lang="en"><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section</b></p></summary>

I did some experimentation with this issue on the Sage language profile from last week. I found that before refreshing, I was still capable of pressing the `fork` button and getting a list of repositories to fork to. After refreshing, the update kicked in, and it went back to taking a long time to load before giving a Unicorn error. So something DID break on GitHub on 2022, Monday, April 11th.

I also tested on my alt account. Since it is only part of 1 organization, it let me in. The update seems to have merged the create a repository from a template, and fork a repository pages together, the first one is extremely inefficient, and hasn't worked for me for over 5 months. That means that fixing it on my main is out of my reach, and I will have to wait for Microsoft to fix this (if they ever do that)

I have a backup plan, which is to join less than 100 organizations with my alt account, and continue to do forks that way. However, I don't want the forks to apply to that account, and I have so many to go through that it would require multiple alt accounts, which I also can't do.

Unfortunately, even with the possible fixes, I can't fork a repository to my main account anymore either, and that can't be done with an alt account as well.

Unfortunately, this issue is not easy to fix. I am considering using a third party to do forks, but I don't know if this will work with my needs.

**Edit on 2022, Friday, April 15th**

When I originally wrote the description for today, I forgot to list 2 important things I tried:

* Disabling JavaScript (uBlock Origin)

This did not help with the problem at all, but I did learn that GitHub can function surprisingly well without JavaScript.

* Preventing images from loading (uBlock Origin)

I prevented some images from loading, but not all the ones I wanted to block. This method did not help with the problem at all either, as I wasn't able to block profile pictures, or media included in `README` files.

**Edit on 2022, Sunday, April 17th**

This isn't going to be a problem. I can automate this task, and save myself several hours of time per week. I have gotten a list of forks ready, I just need to work on my automation scripting in AUTOMATE2001 or GitHubby.

**Edit on 2022, Tuesday, April 26th**

I thought of and successfully tested a basic workaround for this problem, which is:

To fork to my own account:

1. Go to the desired repository

2. Go into edit mode on any file

3. Stop editing the file, as a fork has been successfully made

This is a start, but it won't help at all for the organization part of things. I still intend to automate this task.
