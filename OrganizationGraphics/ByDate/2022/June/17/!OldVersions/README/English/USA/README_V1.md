<details open><summary><p lang="en"><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section</b></p></summary>

I resumed work on organization creation today, I am pretty backed up on it, and continued working on the list.

It will take me a minimum of 11-12 more workdays to get caught up, and they likely won't all be consecutive. <!-- The number isn't changing, as the entry count is still going up. !--> At the current rate, I will finish on 2022, Friday, September 16th.

I had less to do today, as I had the time last night to prepare profiles early. Also, I couldn't fork repositories due to a GitHub update on 2022, Monday, April 11th, although I went slower, since I was working on a new device, and because it took GitHub over 1-2 minutes to load the organization profile picture each time, even though it was already loaded everywhere else.

This was week 20. I am currently scheduled to go to week 32, but the entry count keeps going up, so the week count is going to go up as well. It is going up much slower now, but has gone up by 1 week in the past week.
