# 2022 April 14th üìÖ

## No data üö´

<details open><summary><p lang="en"><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section</b></p></summary>

No new organizations were created on 2022, Thursday, April 14th. There is no new data here.

<!-- I do not plan on creating any new organizations until I get more caught up, and have at least 6 hours of free time on any day (most likely, I will resume next Friday, March 4th) !-->

I am now working off a weekly schedule, set to Friday of each week. I won't resume again until 2022, Friday, April 15th. I hope to finish within the next 12 consecutive weeks, although the workload keeps going up, so I am just trying to get through each week, and hope no more than 9 entries get added per week (I limit myself to 10 per week for time and display reasons, as it already takes 6+ hours for 10, and GitHub wouldn't show an 11th daily entry on my daily activity counter)

I have recently begun to prepare Firefox profiles beforehand (before Friday) this helps save 1-2+ hours of time.

Going with original, unreleased projects last week didn't go well, and took multiple days to complete. I hope to not repeat this next week.

<!-- I will (hopefully) be creating new organizations at some point later this month. At the moment, I have become overloaded, and need to take a break. The list keeps growing faster than I can catch up on it, and it would have taken 3+ more consecutive days of work, which I can't do right now. !-->

This Friday (2022, April 15th) may be different, as I cannot fork repositories at the moment (all attempts to fork a repository ever since Monday, April 11th have resulted in a Unicorn error) and since I require forking projects to an organization to set it up, one step may be skipped this week if the feature isn't added back by 2022, Friday, April 15th at 12:00 pm. This will result in this weeks organizations being created as blanks. I have already reconfigured my todo list so that it is partially compatible with this change. I am developing a long list of projects to fork, when it gets added back, it is going to take a lot of time to get caught back up.

### Research notes

<details open><summary><p lang="en"><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section</b></p></summary>

I did some experimentation with this issue on the Sage language profile from last week. I found that before refreshing, I was still capable of pressing the `fork` button and getting a list of repositories to fork to. After refreshing, the update kicked in, and it went back to taking a long time to load before giving a Unicorn error. So something DID break on GitHub on 2022, Monday, April 11th.

I also tested on my alt account. Since it is only part of 1 organization, it let me in. The update seems to have merged the create a repository from a template, and fork a repository pages together, the first one is extremely inefficient, and hasn't worked for me for over 5 months. That means that fixing it on my main is out of my reach, and I will have to wait for Microsoft to fix this (if they ever do that)

I have a backup plan, which is to join less than 100 organizations with my alt account, and continue to do forks that way. However, I don't want the forks to apply to that account, and I have so many to go through that it would require multiple alt accounts, which I also can't do.

Unfortunately, even with the possible fixes, I can't fork a repository to my main account anymore either, and that can't be done with an alt account as well.

Unfortunately, this issue is not easy to fix. I am considering using a third party to do forks, but I don't know if this will work with my needs.

**Edit on 2022, Friday, April 15th**

When I originally wrote the description for today, I forgot to list 2 important things I tried:

* Disabling JavaScript (uBlock Origin)

This did not help with the problem at all, but I did learn that GitHub can function surprisingly well without JavaScript.

* Preventing images from loading (uBlock Origin)

I prevented some images from loading, but not all the ones I wanted to block. This method did not help with the problem at all eithe, as Iwasn't able to block profile pictures, or media included in `README` files.
