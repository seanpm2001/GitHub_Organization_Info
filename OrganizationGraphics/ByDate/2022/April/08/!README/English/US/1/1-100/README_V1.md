# 2022 April 8th üìÖ

<details open><summary><p lang="en"><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section</b></p></summary>

I resumed work on organization creation today, I am pretty backed up on it, and continued working on the list. It will take me a minimum of 9-10 more workdays to get caught up, and they likely won't all be consecutive. The number isn't changing, as the entry count is still going up. I switched things up this week, and it took much, much longer. I had to cut short, and do the rest of the other half another day (tomorrow)
