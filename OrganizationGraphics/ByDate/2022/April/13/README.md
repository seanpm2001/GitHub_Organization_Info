<details open><summary><p lang="en"><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section</b></p></summary>

No new organizations were created on 2022, Wednesday, April 13th. There is no new data here.

<!-- I do not plan on creating any new organizations until I get more caught up, and have at least 6 hours of free time on any day (most likely, I will resume next Friday, March 4th) !-->

I am now working off a weekly schedule, set to Friday of each week. I won't resume again until 2022, Friday, April 15th. I hope to finish within the next 12 consecutive weeks, although the workload keeps going up, so I am just trying to get through each week, and hope no more than 9 entries get added per week (I limit myself to 10 per week for time and display reasons, as it already takes 6+ hours for 10, and GitHub wouldn't show an 11th daily entry on my daily activity counter)

I have recently begun to prepare Firefox profiles beforehand (before Friday) this helps save 1-2+ hours of time.

Going with original, unreleased projects last week didn't go well, and took multiple days to complete. I hope to not repeat this next week.

<!-- I will (hopefully) be creating new organizations at some point later this month. At the moment, I have become overloaded, and need to take a break. The list keeps growing faster than I can catch up on it, and it would have taken 3+ more consecutive days of work, which I can't do right now. !-->

This Friday (2022, April 15th) may be different, as I cannot fork repositories at the moment (all attempts to fork a repository ever since Monday, April 11th have resulted in a Unicorn error) and since I require forking projects to an organization to set it up, one step may be skipped this week if the feature isn't added back by 2022, Friday, April 15th at 12:00 pm. This will result in this weeks organizations being created as blanks. I have already reconfigured my todo list so that it is partially compatible with this change. I am developing a long list of projects to fork, when it gets added back, it is going to take a lot of time to get caught back up.
