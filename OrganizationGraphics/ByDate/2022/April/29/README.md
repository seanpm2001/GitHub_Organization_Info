I resumed work on organization creation today, I am pretty backed up on it, and continued working on the list.

It will take me a minimum of 9-12 more workdays to get caught up, and they likely won't all be consecutive. The number isn't changing, as the entry count is still going up.

I had less to do today, and finished the creation process very quickly (in less than 1 hour and 50 minutes) Also, I couldn't fork repositories due to a GitHub update on 2022, Monday, April 11th, this was a major contributor to this speedy finish.

This was week 13. I am currently scheduled to go to week 26, but the entry count keeps going up, so the week count is going to go up as well. GitHub was very unstable during the whole process today.
