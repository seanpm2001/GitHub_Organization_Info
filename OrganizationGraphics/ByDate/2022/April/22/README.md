<details open><summary><p lang="en"><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section</b></p></summary>

I resumed work on organization creation today, I am pretty backed up on it, and continued working on the list. It will take me a minimum of 9-12 more workdays to get caught up, and they likely won't all be consecutive. The number isn't changing, as the entry count is still going up. I had less to do today, and finished the creation process very quickyl (in less than 1 hour and 50 minutes) Also, I couldn't fork repositories due to a GitHub update on 2022, Monday, April 11th, this was a major contributor to this speedy finish.
