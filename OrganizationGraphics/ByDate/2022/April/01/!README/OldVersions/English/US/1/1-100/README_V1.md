# 2022 April 1st üìÖ

<details open><summary><p lang="en"><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section</b></p></summary>

I resumed work on organization creation today, I am pretty backed up on it, and continued working on the list. It will take me a minimum of 9-10 more workdays to get caught up, and they likely won't all be consecutive. The number isn't changing, as the entry count is still going up. I completed all creation work in less than 3 hours again this week.
