<details open><summary><p lang="en"><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section</b></p></summary>

No new organizations were created on 2022, Monday, April 4th. There is no new data here.

<!-- I do not plan on creating any new organizations until I get more caught up, and have at least 6 hours of free time on any day (most likely, I will resume next Friday, March 4th) !-->

I am now working off a weekly schedule, set to Friday of each week. I won't resume again until 2022, Friday, April 8th. I hope to finish within the next 12 consecutive weeks, although the workload keeps going up, so I am just trying to get through each week, and hope no more than 9 entries get added per week (I limit myself to 10 per week for time and display reasons, as it already takes 6+ hours for 10, and GitHub wouldn't show an 11th daily entry on my daily activity counter)

I have recently begun to prepare Firefox profiles beforehand (before Friday) this helps save 1-2+ hours of time.

<!-- I will (hopefully) be creating new organizations at some point later this month. At the moment, I have become overloaded, and need to take a break. The list keeps growing faster than I can catch up on it, and it would have taken 3+ more consecutive days of work, which I can't do right now. !-->
