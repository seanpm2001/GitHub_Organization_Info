# 2022 April 15th üìÖ

I resumed work on organization creation today, I am pretty backed up on it, and continued working on the list. It will take me a minimum of 9-12 more workdays to get caught up, and they likely won't all be consecutive. The number isn't changing, as the entry count is still going up. I switched things up this week, and it took less time, as I put less focus onto user attribution. Also, I couldn't fork repositories due to a GitHub update on 2022, Monday, April 11th, so this took much less time today.
