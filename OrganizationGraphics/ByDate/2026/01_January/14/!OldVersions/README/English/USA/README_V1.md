## [Old description (timeline part 1) ⏳️](#Old-description-timeline-part-1-)

<details><summary><p lang="en"><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section</b></p></summary>

- On 2022, Tuesday, July 19th, my account was flagged for unknown reasons. I am hoping to have it recovered as soon as possible. As of 2022 Sunday, August 21st (day 34) it is still flagged, but I did receive a response on 2022 Wednesday, August 3rd at 11:57 am. I am now going to have to delete all of my organizations from GitHub and stop creating them here. I will now be creating them on a private server, instead of GitHub. This project has been suspended, but data will still be added here. I have released the notes for the year, as I don't plan to continue creating organizations.
- - A daily message will be written here, and the follows directory will still be updated. This is a huge loss for me, and it isn't going to be easy at all for me.

### [2022 August 4th 🗓️](#2022-August-4th-)

<details open><summary><p lang="en"><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section</b></p></summary>

GitHub is currently refusing to let me delete my organizations, and is even refusing to delete my organizations themselves. This is a tricky situation for getting my account back.

### [2022 August 5th 🗓️](#2022-August-5th-)

<details open><summary><p lang="en"><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section</b></p></summary>

I went back and checked, after I sent them the message to delete all of my organizations, they secretly unlocked the delete button. It looks like this is going to have to be done manually, which will take a while. I am doing final documentation on the organizations before each delete, this will take more time as I get closer to the top of the list, where complexity increases.

**Deletion log notes:**

**Daily log:**

| #️⃣️ Day | 📝️ Status notes |
|--------|------------------|
| **Day 0:** | _I received the instruction to delete organizations, I tried doing it automatically, which failed, so I planned to start doing it manually the next day._ |
| **Day 1:** | _The 140 organizations deleted today don't have in-depth screenshots, as the organizations were empty, and already had screenshot documentation of themselves._ |
| **Day 2:** | _80 organizations were deleted today, in-depth screenshots started today as well._ |
| **Day 3:** | _I had a difficult time today, and was only able to delete 60 organizations._ |
| **Day 4:** | _I now plan to delete 80 organizations per day consistently until I finish deleting all of them._ |
| **Day 5:** | _I continued with the plan of deleting 80 per day today. `seanpm2001-all` and `seanwallawalla-forks` were deleted, but still persist on my profile, despite the fact that any user (even me) that visits them gets a 404 error._ |
| **Day 6:** | _I accidentally deleted 1 extra organization today._ |
| **Day 7:** | _I deleted 79 organizations today, instead of 80, to even out yesterdays mistake. I will continue to delete organizations 80 at a time tomorrow._ |
| **Day 8:** | _I went back to deleting 80 organizations per day today. I expect to finish in 4 days. Today, I also have noted that my "what's left" screenshot contains an error (Firefox has been wrapping my username across a whole line of the list) it is possible to be fixed in the future with data and image manipulation._ |
| **Day 9:** | _I suffered significant losses today, some of my most important organizations had to be deleted. There were some really special ones today._ |
| **Day 10:** | _I finished deleting all non-SNU organizations today. My 'What's left' screenshot also contained no errors today, as the image wasn't wrapped due to how small the selection was._ _Seanpm2001-Ubuntu was deleted today after several linked snaps were no longer available, thus they did not show up in the documentation. It is possible to recreate this data - 2022 August 14th_ |
| **Day 11:** | _Only SNU organizations are left, and they all have the same icon. Tomorrow will be the last day of this project._ |
| **Day 12:** | _I deleted the last 80 organizations today, which were all SNU organizations. During the last 22 entries, GitHub was deleting organizations by the time I got back to my profile from going back 3 pages, normally, I would have to reload the page first. The project is now complete, and I am contemplating what to do next to try and get my account back. The organization list would be empty if `seanpm2001-all` and `seanwallawalla-forks` would have gone away, but they have persisted for 7 days now._ |
| **Day 13:** | _The project was completed yesterday. No data is available to delete. Although, I now notice that the option to `switch to another account` is gone. `seanpm2001-all` and `seanwallawalla-forks` have still not gone away, they have persisted for 8 days now._ |
| **Day 14:** | _No data for today, the `seanpm2001-all` and `seanwallawalla-forks` organizations have still not gone away, persisting for 9 days now. I worry it might interfere with my appeal._ |
| **Day 15:** | _No data for today, the `seanpm2001-all` and `seanwallawalla-forks` organizations have still not gone away, persisting for 10 days now. I worry it might interfere with my appeal. I sent an appeal tonight._ |
| **Day 16:** | _No data for today, although I updated the table to make some enhancements, and fix a spelling error in the title. The `seanpm2001-all` and `seanwallawalla-forks` organizations have still not gone away, persisting for 11 days now. I worry it might interfere with my appeal that was sent last night._ |

| #️⃣️ Entry number | 🪵️ **Additional log:** |
|------------------|------------------------|
| **#️⃣️1** | The organizations `Seanpm2001-all` and `seanwallawalla-forks` were deleted on 2022, Thursday, August 9th. As of 2022, Sunday, August 14th, they still appear on my profile, despite being completely deleted, with no way for me or anyone else to access them (you just get a 404 page) it has been over 120 hours. |
| **#️⃣️2** | On 2022 Monday, August 8th, I decided to set the amount of orgs deleted per day to 80 (8x8=64) so that I can have a consistent and measured reduction in just 8 days. I expect to finish on 2022, Tuesday, August 16th. If things don't go as planned, it may take longer. |
| **#️⃣️3** | I updated my second account ([`@seanwallawalla`](https://github.com/seanwallawalla/)) on 2022 August 9th, removing the reference to `seanwallawalla-software` and changing the location to match my main account. |
| **#️⃣️4** | I began getting screenshots of the rendered markdown table on 2022, August 15th. |
| **#️⃣️5** | Despite no data before 2022 August 5th, and after August 16th, I still really felt like updating the table to reflect these days. |

## [Life under account suspension 🚔️](#Life-under-account-suspension-)

<details open><summary><p lang="en"><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section</b></p></summary>

During the account suspension, my time on GitHub was pretty different. At this time, Multi-Factor Authentication wasn't being pushed on GitHub, so I could easily log in and out, and also continue work (but I couldn't interact with anyone, or have anyone interact with me) I fear now that MFA is mandatory that this may make the situation harder, as I fear GitHub may refuse to send out a verification SMS to a suspended account.

Some daily processes stopped temporarily. My `GitHub_Stats_A` workflow went through its longest consecutive failure streak, as the API was refusing to let the workflow run. I tried transferring my account over to GitLab, in a last ditch effort, but GitHub wouldn't let me, even though it feels like one of the times it should let you. I ended up having to lose all of the organizations to be able to resume normally, and access returned randomly during another difficult time in my life, where my first Linux laptop had its first kernel panic.

I feel a lot of potential was lost in this time, as it was over a month of time where people couldn't access/see my repositories and my work.

## [Post-deletion commentary 🗣️](#Post-deletion-commentary-)

<details open><summary><p lang="en"><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section</b></p></summary>

Starting on 2023, Thursday, August 17th, my main GitHub account has reached the complexity level where it takes more than 6 hours to scan my profile/account in full (through GitHub actions) This has crippled the success of my [:octocat: `GitHub Stats A`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/GitHub_Stats_A/) workflow, and there is no way to fix it, as my workload only gets heavier. It would have been nice to be able to keep my organizations, as then I could split the repositories up, and this wouldn't be a problem, even if I got to keep just 1 or 2. The failure rate for this month on this project has now gone up significantly just this week, and I feel that fully successful runs are no longer possible (only partial success are possible now)

I have a form of digital irredentism now. I have been trying to weaken it, but this incident really left a mark on me that still hurts every once in a while (even as of 2023, Monday, August 21st)

Technically, GitHub still says I have 2 organizations, but I actually don't, as even though `@seanp2001-all` and `@seanwallawalla-forks` show up as organizations I still control in multiple places, visiting either one (either with my main account or without) returns a 404. It was a glitch that was left behind. I can still even see the forks they made, but I can't visit these forks, and they also show up publicly as well.

I used my organizations for project management and sorting. I have no idea why Microsoft claimed I was "domain squatting" as the majority of organizations used my main username, or a name that I had created. They never told me which organizations were considered "squatting" it seems individuals cannot have organizations in this way, while corporations like Google can.

Before the deletions, I was constantly worried about people taking my domain names. The tables flipped on 2022, July 19th, but I still fear people will take the names, but I now know I can do nothing about it. I am still waiting for someone to "squat" on my former organization names.

On 2025, February 23rd, I have been thinking about how this process has eased up some of my tasks and time, such as forcing me to go from having to maintain and create GitHub pages for so many organizations, reducing how much time I need per day for development, and reducing the amount of forking needed. At the same time, I miss this functionality.

### [What is digital irredentism ❓️](#What-is-digital-irredentism-)

<details open><summary><p lang="en"><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section</b></p></summary>

Digital irredentism is the belief that digital data one once held by them, still belongs to them. In this case, I feel that the organization deletion was undeserved for most of them, as GitHub didn't specify which organizations were "cybersquatting" and the majority of them used a name I own. I agree now that 1000 organizations may have been too many, but it doesn't make sense that corporations can create as many organizations as they want (IE: Google) but individuals can't. I also don't get why they didn't stop me until I had made 1000 organizations, there was a nearly 2 year long window in which they could have said something, as I had been producing 10 per week for several months on end, and nothing was said in this time.

### [Recreating organizations as repositories 🏗️](#Recreating-organizations-as-repositories-)

<details open><summary><p lang="en"><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section</b></p></summary>

I have been recreating organizations as repositories since the mass deletion, but it still isn't as helpful as having a separate space to organize projects. The 2 compromises I made with the deletion are:

- 1. The organizations will be recreated on a local server next time
- 2. Organization names can be used in new repositories to mark them as homepages

This is still an active progress that has had a spiked development schedule. The next organization to be recreated is `Seanpm2001-SUPERCELL` via the [:octocat: `SUPERCELL`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/SUPERCELL/) and [:octocat: `Seanpm201-SUPERCELL`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Seanpm2001-SUPERCELL/) repositories, which will be created on 2023, Saturday, September 2nd. Many others have been created before this, and many others don't need to be created, as they already have home repositories with the original organization names.

A timeline of this whole process is not yet available, due to time constraints in making it. It should be listed in this section in the future.

### [Missing out 〽️](#Missing-out-)

<details open><summary><p lang="en"><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section</b></p></summary>

I am missing out on the ability to better organize my projects, and use GitHub organization features that I was once able to use, particularly:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>

- Being able to sort my projects into groups, so that they are easier to manage
- Being able to see the top languages of each of my projects
- Being able to see every language I work with in a single dropdown, rather than a listing from the last 3-7 days
- Being able to customize the profile for each project
- Being able to test various GitHub Pages Sites

    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

I don't think I am capable of going back now anyways. It seems to be just a SaaSS trap.

#### [Overview (research notes) 📄️](#Overview-research-notes-)

<details open><summary><p lang="en"><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section (overview)</b></p></summary>

- I did some experimentation with this issue on the Sage language profile from last week. I found that before refreshing, I was still capable of pressing the `fork` button and getting a list of repositories to fork to. After refreshing, the update kicked in, and it went back to taking a long time to load before giving a Unicorn error. So something DID break on GitHub on 2022, Monday, April 11th.
- I also tested on my alt account. Since it is only part of 1 organization, it let me in. The update seems to have merged the create a repository from a template, and fork a repository pages together, the first one is extremely inefficient, and hasn't worked for me for over 5 months. That means that fixing it on my main is out of my reach, and I will have to wait for Microsoft to fix this (if they ever do that)
- I have a backup plan, which is to join less than 100 organizations with my alt account, and continue to do forks that way. However, I don't want the forks to apply to that account, and I have so many to go through that it would require multiple alt accounts, which I also can't do.
- Unfortunately, even with the possible fixes, I can't fork a repository to my main account anymore either, and that can't be done with an alt account as well.
- Unfortunately, this issue is not easy to fix. I am considering using a third party to do forks, but I don't know if this will work with my needs.

<details open><summary><p lang="en"><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section</b></p></summary>

**Edit on 2022, Friday, April 15th**

When I originally wrote the description for today, I forgot to list 2 important things I tried:

- Disabling JavaScript (uBlock Origin)

This did not help with the problem at all, but I did learn that GitHub can function surprisingly well without JavaScript.

- Preventing images from loading (uBlock Origin)

I prevented some images from loading, but not all the ones I wanted to block. This method did not help with the problem at all either, as I wasn't able to block profile pictures, or media included in `README` files.

**Edit on 2022, Sunday, April 17th**

This isn't going to be a problem. I can automate this task, and save myself several hours of time per week. I have gotten a list of forks ready, I just need to work on my automation scripting in AUTOMATE2001 or GitHubby.

<details open><summary><p lang="en"><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section</b></p></summary>

**Edit on 2022, Tuesday, April 26th**

I thought of and successfully tested a basic workaround for this problem, which is:

_To fork to my own account:_

- 1. Go to the desired repository
- 2. Go into edit mode on any file
- 3. Stop editing the file, as a fork has been successfully made

This is a start, but it won't help at all for the organization part of things. I still intend to automate this task.
