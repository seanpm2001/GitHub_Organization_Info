# GitHub Pages webpages

This directory is for storing images of GitHub Pages webpages. It is not to be confused with GitHub organization webpages.

As of August 15th 2021, I have not started documenting this, due to the load on my RAM to take a screenshot of a long webpage (it will add 200+ megabytes to my SWAP that won't go away until I restart per screenshot)
