# Organization webpages

This directory is for storing images of GitHub organization webpages. It is not to be confused with GitHub Pages webpages.

I started documenting this better in early August 2021, as on August 5th 2021, the layout for GitHub organizations changed significantly, and I highly disliked it. I want to document what my organizations look like to users in case the interface gets worse.

On August 15th 2021, I found that 1 webpage in my Git-image Sunday profile didn't fully refresh, and I was able to get 2 pictures of the old layout for archival purposes. There were no other images I could find online with 5 minutes of image browsing, so these might be the last surviving copies of the layout (if not, maybe just for this organization)
