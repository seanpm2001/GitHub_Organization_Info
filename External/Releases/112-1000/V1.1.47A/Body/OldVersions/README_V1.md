# Version 1.1.47A - 2022 Friday, March 18th

## V1.1.47A

### Changes:

This is the Hundred-thirty-first release of this project. It contains the basic data for 8w0 organizations (fork count minus 2) related notes, and images. It is missing data for 2 organizations. This is the actual 131st release. I made a mistake with the 44th release, and upon fixing it, it created a duplicate release. This notice is getting kind of dated (old) but it explains why this is V130 and not V131. I intend to keep it until it makes a large enough dent. For now, I just plan to keep this notice as long as possible.

This is the seventh set of releases for the year of 2022, as I made time to work on this project on 2022 Friday, March 18th. I have plans to continue for a minimum of 9 more consecutive weeks, the number hasn't changed, as more entries are still being added on an almost-daily basis.

I received my first external fork on this project 2 weeks ago, and now the fork count can't be relied upon for getting the organization count. Luckily, I have plenty of other indicators and measures for this. I was hoping I could get to 1000 before this happened, but it's fine.

See below for more changes.
