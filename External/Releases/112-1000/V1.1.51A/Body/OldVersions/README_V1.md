<details open><summary><p lang="en">Click/tap here to expand/collapse the lead section</p></summary>

This is the Hundred-thirty-ninth release of this project. It contains the basic data for 870 organizations, related notes, and images. It is missing data for 2 organizations. This is the actual 139th release. I made a mistake with the 44th release, and upon fixing it, it created a duplicate release. This notice is getting kind of dated (old) but it explains why this is V139 and not V140. I intend to keep it until it makes a large enough dent. For now, I just plan to keep this notice as long as possible.

This is the eleventh set of releases for the year of 2022, as I made time to work on this project on 2022 Friday, April 8th. I have plans to continue for a minimum of 12 more consecutive weeks, the number hasn't gone down, as more entries are still being added on an almost-daily basis.

I received my first external fork on this project on 2022 March 18th, and now the fork count can't be relied upon for getting the organization count. Luckily, I have plenty of other indicators and measures for this. I was hoping I could get to 1000 before this happened, but it's fine. There has been another external fork on 2022 April 1st as well (total forks not by me, as of this release: 2)

On Monday, 2022 April 11th, GitHub released an update with bad performance that redirects project forks to a page I cannot access (it only times out and gives me a unicorn error) I cannot fork any repositories at the moment, including this one. I am working on making a tool to automate forks, so I don't have to spend time with it. I feel this will save me time.

When working on the setup process yesterday, I spent too much time doing attribution and other tasks, and ran out of time to work on organization work, so I saved further attribution for another day, and the finalization of the April 15th update on 2022, Saturday, April 16th. I have been careful not to add anything that would have been added on April 16th to the development of these releases.

See below for more changes.
