# Version 1.1.45B - 2022 Friday, March 4th

## V1.1.45B

### Changes:

This is the Hundred-twenty-eighth release of this project. It contains the basic data for 810 organizations, <!-- (fork count minus 2) !--> related notes, and images. It is missing data for 2 organizations. This is the actual 128th release. I made a mistake with the 44th release, and upon fixing it, it created a duplicate release. This notice is getting kind of dated (old) but it explains why this is V128 and not V129. I intend to keep it until it makes a large enough dent. For now, I just plan to keep this notice as long as possible.

This is the fifth set of releases for the year of 2022, as I made time to work on this project on 2022 Friday, March 4th. I have plans to continue for a minimum of 9 more consecutive weeks.

I received my first external fork on this project this week, and now the fork count can't be relied upon for getting the organization count. Luckily, I have plenty of other indicators and measures for this. I was hoping I could get to 1000 before this happened, but it's fine.

See below for more changes.
