# Version 1.1.36A - 2021 November 27th

## V1.1.36A

### Changes:

This is the Hundred-ninth release of this project. It contains the basic data for 726 organizations, <!-- (fork count minus 2) !--> related notes, and images. It is missing data for 2 organizations. This is the actual 109th release. I made a mistake with the 44th release, and upon fixing it, it created a duplicate release. This notice is getting kind of dated (old) but it explains why this is V109 and not V110. I intend to keep it until it makes a large enough dent. For now, I just plan to keep this notice as long as possible.

I started another batch of organizations off a new growing list, I only did the language organizations today. I plan to do the rest tomorrow. This release also contains higher level documentation, as the documentation level was upgraded today.

See below for more changes.
