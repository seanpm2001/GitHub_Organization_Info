# Version 1.1.14A - August 25th 2021

## V1.1.14A

### Changes:

This is the sixty-seventh release of this project. It contains the basic data for 648 organizations, <!-- (fork count minus 2) !--> related notes, and images. It is missing data for 2 organizations. This is the actual 67th release. I made a mistake with the 44th release, and upon fixing it, it created a duplicate release. This notice is getting kind of dated (old) but it explains why this is V67 and not V68. I intend to keep it until it makes a large enough dent. For now, I just plan to keep this notice as long as possible.

This set of releases came 4 days late due to recent management and maintenance issues.
