# Version 1.1.19A - 2021 September 16th

## V1.1.19A

### Changes:

This is the Seventy-seventh release of this project. It contains the basic data for 662 organizations, <!-- (fork count minus 2) !--> related notes, and images. It is missing data for 2 organizations. This is the actual 77th release. I made a mistake with the 44th release, and upon fixing it, it created a duplicate release. This notice is getting kind of dated (old) but it explains why this is V77 and not V78. I intend to keep it until it makes a large enough dent. For now, I just plan to keep this notice as long as possible.

### Changes

This is version 77, the A variant of version 77 to 78. It includes the following changes:

- [x] Updated discussion data
