# Version 1.1.21B - 2021 September 20th

## V1.1.21B

### Changes:

This is the Eighty-second release of this project. It contains the basic data for 665 organizations, <!-- (fork count minus 2) !--> related notes, and images. It is missing data for 2 organizations. This is the actual 82nd release. I made a mistake with the 44th release, and upon fixing it, it created a duplicate release. This notice is getting kind of dated (old) but it explains why this is V82 and not V83. I intend to keep it until it makes a large enough dent. For now, I just plan to keep this notice as long as possible.
