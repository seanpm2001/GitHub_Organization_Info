# Version 1.1.22A - 2021 October 6th

## V1.1.22A

### Changes:

This is the Eighty-third release of this project. It contains the basic data for 667 organizations, <!-- (fork count minus 2) !--> related notes, and images. It is missing data for 2 organizations. This is the actual 83rd release. I made a mistake with the 44th release, and upon fixing it, it created a duplicate release. This notice is getting kind of dated (old) but it explains why this is V83 and not V84. I intend to keep it until it makes a large enough dent. For now, I just plan to keep this notice as long as possible.

This set of releases is coming 1 day late, as I ran out of time last night.
