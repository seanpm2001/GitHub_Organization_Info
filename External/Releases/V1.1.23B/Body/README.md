# Version 1.1.23B - 2021 October 8th

## V1.1.23B

### Changes:

This is the Eighty-sixth release of this project. It contains the basic data for 667 organizations, <!-- (fork count minus 2) !--> related notes, and images. It is missing data for 2 organizations. This is the actual 84th release. I made a mistake with the 44th release, and upon fixing it, it created a duplicate release. This notice is getting kind of dated (old) but it explains why this is V86 and not V87. I intend to keep it until it makes a large enough dent. For now, I just plan to keep this notice as long as possible.

This is a followup to a release that contains no info on new organizations, but is a major structuring update for this project that was worked on from Thursday 2021 October 7th to Friday 2021 October 8th. This release finalizes it by doing some small changes, including:
