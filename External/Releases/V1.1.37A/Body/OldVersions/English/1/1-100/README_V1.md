# Version 1.1.37A - 2021 November 28th

## V1.1.37A

### Changes:

This is the Hundred-eleventh release of this project. It contains the basic data for 730 organizations, <!-- (fork count minus 2) !--> related notes, and images. It is missing data for 2 organizations. This is the actual 111th release. I made a mistake with the 44th release, and upon fixing it, it created a duplicate release. This notice is getting kind of dated (old) but it explains why this is V111 and not V112. I intend to keep it until it makes a large enough dent. For now, I just plan to keep this notice as long as possible.

The current batch of new organizations concluded on 2021 November 28th, but I didn't get to publishing the set of releases until the next day, as I ran out of time. I already have more building up, but I won't get to it until 2021 December. This set of releases is from 2021 November 29th, but covers data for 2021 November 28th.

See below for more changes.
