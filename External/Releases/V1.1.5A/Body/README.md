# Version 1.1.5A - July 19th 2021

## V1.1.5A

### Changes:

This is the forty-ninth release of this project. It contains the basic data for 620 organizations, <!-- (fork count minus 2) !--> related notes, and images. It is missing data for 2 organizations. This is the actual 49th release. I made a mistake with the 44th release, and upon fixing it, it created a duplicate release.

This release was delayed several days due to time reasons. There could have been an additional 2-4 releases made in between, but this is the official 49.0 release. If needed, a 48.1A, 48.1B, 48.2A, and/or 48.2B release may be made in the future.

### Changes

This is version 49, the A variant of version 49 to 50. It includes the following changes:

- [x] Updated discussion data

- [x] Updated release data
