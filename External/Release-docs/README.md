# Release docs

_Special documentation related to this projects release history._

**File version:** `1 (Friday, July 23rd 2021 at 7:59 pm)`

## New release system (V1-onward)

### V1 release header

This is the first release of this project. It contains the basic data for 410 organizations, related notes, and images. It is missing data for 2 organizations. I should have started producing releases a lot earlier.

I am also starting a discussion based on this update, my first time doing so.

### What this means

For a majority of this projects history, I didn't do releases every day that I made changes to the project. Releases are now a scheduled event.

## Duplicate release (V44)

I made a mistake with the 44th release, and upon fixing it, it created a duplicate release. I have kept notices of this duplicate release in the release notes of all subsequent releases (as of v52/v53) but I needed to document this issue in better detail, in case the note gets removed on purpose or by accident.

## More
