Legal notice: due to Red Cross logo restrictions, I used the Swiss (ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡­ Switzerland) flag instead. The Red Cross/Red Crescent movement is known to be abusive when it come to their logo (which is just an inverted version of the flag of ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡­ Switzerland, or ğŸ‡¹ğŸ‡· Turkey. Other than that, the Red Cross/crescent movement is good) Also: my health software is designed to help, but it isn't 100% accurate and isn't a 100% guarantee in saving a life.
