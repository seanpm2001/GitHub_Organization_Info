# Usage of language organizations

I starred making organizations dedicated to the sorting and easy access of projects written in specific languages. Organizations are used as a tool for me to give projects and project categories their own platform.

## Mixed decision

I made a decision on May 14th 2021 to mix the language topics together. I had a nearly week long debate with myself on if projects (such as Python) could fit with HTML or other projects and be in multiple language categories. I decided in favor, and now each topic will contain projects with non-dominant related languages.
