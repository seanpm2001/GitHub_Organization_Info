# Info

This is a collection of notes I used to create organizations this month (May 2021) At first, I limited myself to 7 per day, but raised it up to a complete maximum of 10 per day on the 10th of May (May 10th 2021)

## Public

Currently, the first 14 versions are public, newer versions will have a waiting period, as I can't give out the organization names yet. The process is currently expected to finish on July 22nd 2021 (current goal)

## Language

The files are written in Ruby. Originally, it was to make the files stand out, and to have easier-to-read highlighting, but I switched to Ruby, so I could learn the basics of the language, and work with Ruby data.

Most of the files won't run, or won't run correctly. It is recommended to just view their source code.
