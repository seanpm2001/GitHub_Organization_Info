Time
-----------

I have noted an activity that is using up the majority of your time on creating organizations:

* Over 1 hour of time is used to set up and customize Firefox profiles.

Proposed fix: set up the Firefox profiles the week prior, customize them a litte bit day by day, at a pace of at least 2 profiles per day (for 5 days)

Fix test 1: I set up all the profiles the night before, and finished at least 1 hour earlier. I plan to do this again.

Development history
===

This project originated out of a note block in my personal journal. It was moved out and started getting cleaned up early in 2022, and later became a weekly entry log.

Debug
===

On 2022 March 30th, when editing this document, I was swapping entries around. Upon finishing, I noticed the file was 2 lines shorter, and I couldn't figure out what went wrong. I only modified a 5 week range of data, so if there seems to be missing entries, I can search here for then in 6 weeks (2022, May 6th)

This section has been moved out on 2022 March 26th, as the project was started elsewhere. Mention of this project should not disappear for a while, however. I need to keep it fresh in memory.

RFR (Request For Removal) DENIED ❌️: The project has started, and is in a healthy state, but this notice must remain until the decision to publish the organization is made, AND until the organization is published.

RFR rebuttal 1: "[To myself] But these rules are stupid" REJECTED ❌️ The rules still stand.

RFR Comment 1: "I love democracy" - Senator Palpatine

/// I took the joke too far, but the rules still stand, I want to make the point that sections like this will stand.
