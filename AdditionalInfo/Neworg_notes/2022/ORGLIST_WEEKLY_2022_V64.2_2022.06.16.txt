<?php { Context 
So lately, I have been considering a new malicious idea. background: I hate screen notches. There is a portion of the screen that you can’t see, and this software will make use of this. You will only face an issue if you try to post the footage online. The area where the notch in can contain whatever it wants. In the safe variant, you can have several SFW patterns. However, in the NSFW/NSFL variants, bannable offenses will be posted in the part of the screen where you can’t see. I won’t go as far to put illegal content there, This idea kind of shits on my “malware as a form of art” stance, maybe this will be the start of the malicious notch movement, and eventually, the notch will be removed. Something must be done.
