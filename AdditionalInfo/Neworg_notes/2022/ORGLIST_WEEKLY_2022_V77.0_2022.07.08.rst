Week 11 (2022, Friday, April 15th) ☑️
-----------

Note: GitHub began having a problem this week (Monday, April 11th) where I can't fork repositories (it just times out and goes to the Unicorn error screen) I am hoping the issue is fixed by Friday, but just in case, I have swapped some entries around. This week might again look different than previous weeks

Entries are also now being numbered, as it is too difficult to count every single asterisk without making a mistake.

Time
-----------

I have noted an activity that is using up the majority of your time on creating organizations:

* Over 1 hour of time is used to set up and customize Firefox profiles.

Proposed fix: set up the Firefox profiles the week prior, customize them a litte bit day by day, at a pace of at least 2 profiles per day (for 5 days)

Fix test 1: I set up all the profiles the night before, and finished at least 1 hour earlier. I plan to do this again.

Salvaged 2022 May 13th
====

I made a mistake with the entries on May 13th, and one may have been removed. I swapped around all the non-language entries, so they come last. Unfortunately, 1 entry may have been dropped. This is what I could salvage (an `❌️` indicates I have confirmed it still exists)

Development history
===

This project originated out of a note block in my personal journal. It was moved out and started getting cleaned up early in 2022, and later became a weekly entry log.

Debug
===

On 2022 March 30th, when editing this document, I was swapping entries around. Upon finishing, I noticed the file was 2 lines shorter, and I couldn't figure out what went wrong. I only modified a 5 week range of data, so if there seems to be missing entries, I can search here for then in 6 weeks (2022, May 6th)

🔘️ = Is not a duplicate
♦️ = Is a duplicate
🌠️ = Confirmed to be a missing entry, recovered

This section has been moved out on 2022 March 26th, as the project was started elsewhere. Mention of this project should not disappear for a while, however. I need to keep it fresh in memory.

RFR (Request For Removal) DENIED ❌️: The project has started, and is in a healthy state, but this notice must remain until the decision to publish the organization is made, AND until the organization is published.

RFR rebuttal 1: "[To myself] But these rules are stupid" REJECTED ❌️ The rules still stand.

RFR Comment 1: "I love democracy" - Senator Palpatine

/// I took the joke too far, but the rules still stand, I want to make the point that sections like this will stand.
