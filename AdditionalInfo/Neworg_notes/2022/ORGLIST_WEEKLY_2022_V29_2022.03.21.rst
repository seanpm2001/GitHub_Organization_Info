Time
-----------

I have noted an activity that is using up the majority of your time on creating organizations:

* Over 1 hour of time is used to set up and customize Firefox profiles.

Proposed fix: set up the Firefox profiles the week prior, customize them a litte bit day by day, at a pace of at least 2 profiles per day (for 5 days)

Fix test 1: I set up all the profiles the night before, and finished at least 1 hour earlier. I plan to do this again.

Development history
===

This project originated out of a note block in my personal journal. It was moved out and started getting cleaned up early in 2022, and later became a weekly entry log.

March 1: No Cellular KA data
