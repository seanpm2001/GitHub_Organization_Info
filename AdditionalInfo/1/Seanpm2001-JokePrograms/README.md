# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-JokePrograms

## Description

For the archive and development of my joke program projects, under the Seanpm2001 name.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-JokePrograms](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-JokePrograms)

This organization is used for the archival and development of my projects that are joke programs meant to be humorous and less serious. This is the Seanpm2001 variant, not the Seanwallawalla variant, more info on this is available below.

### Extra info

The previous project (at [seanwallawalla-jokeprograms](/AdditionalInfo/1/seanwallawalla-jokeprograms/)) uses the old SWW (SeanWallaWalla) branding (2015-2019) the preferred format is now SPM2001 (Seanpm2001)

The original (and old) Comedy Central logo was used on this project for nostalgia reasons, and to differentiate with the other organization.
