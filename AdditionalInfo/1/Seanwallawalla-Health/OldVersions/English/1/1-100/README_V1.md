# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-Health

## Description

For the archive and development of my health/medical program projects, under the Seanpm2001 name.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Health](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Health)

This organization is for Health projects, as I am happy to be committing open source technology to the medical field, and helping save lives without a doctors degree.

## Extra info

Legal notice: due to Red Cross logo restrictions, I used the Swiss (switzerland Switzerland) flag instead. The Red Cross/Red Crescent movement is known to be abusive when it come to their logo (which is just an inverted version of the flag of switzerland Switzerland, or tr Turkey. Other than that, the Red Cross/crescent movement is good) Also: my health software is designed to help, but it isn't 100% accurate and isn't a 100% guarantee in saving a life.
