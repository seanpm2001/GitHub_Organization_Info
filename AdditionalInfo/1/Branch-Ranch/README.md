# GitHub organization: Branch-Ranch

## Description

This GitHub organization is for my April 2021 Git joke program.

## More info

[https://github.com/Branch-Ranch](https://github.com/Branch-Ranch)

This organization is for the development of a humorous out-of-season (not a normal April Fools joke) April Fools joke that I created on April 1st 2021. It is based around Git-branches, and has humorous branches. Branch-Ranch is a collection of joke branches, with play-on-words, puns, and creativity.
