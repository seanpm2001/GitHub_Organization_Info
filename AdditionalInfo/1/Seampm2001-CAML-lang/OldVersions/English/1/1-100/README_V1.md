# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-CAML-lang

## Description

For the development of my projects written in the CAML programming language, or containing CAML source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-CAML-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-CAML-lang)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in CAML. The original rule was that CAML had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any CAML code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

### Extra notes

Not to be confused with ML, standard ML, or OCaml. This also isn't a camel (animal)
