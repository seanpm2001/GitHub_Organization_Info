# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-JupyterNotebook-lang

## Description

For the development of my projects written in the Jupyter Notebook language, or containing Jupyter Notebook source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-JupyterNotebook-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-JupyterNotebook-lang)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in Jupyters Notebook. The original rule was that Jupyters Notebook had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any Jupyters Notebook code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

### Extra notes

I could not find a skeuomorphic version of the logo for the Jupyter project, so I used the main logo.
