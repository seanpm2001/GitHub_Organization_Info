# GitHub organization: Talla-browser

## Description

For the development of the Talla browser.

## More info

[https://github.com/Talla-browser](https://github.com/Talla-browser)

This organization is used for the development of my web browser concept, Talla browser, which is a highly customizable, privacy focused, and highly compatible web browser. Development is being done at a low rate, as I am not experienced enough yet to write a web browser. The project is in early development.

### Extra notes

The current stock image for this organization is the Deer Park alpha logo, the logo used in early 1.x Alpha builds of Firefox. I feel like the image has the PNG checkers in the background, but I can't find a version without something similar. I didn't notice until I had already applied it. Whoever did that did a really good job at making a good image bad.

I am using it as the placeholder, as I don't have a logo idea for Talla browser yet.
