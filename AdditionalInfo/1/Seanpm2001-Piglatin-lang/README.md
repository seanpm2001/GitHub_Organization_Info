# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-Piglatin-lang

## Description

My GitHub organization for my projects written in Apache Pig/PigLatin.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Piglatin-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Piglatin-lang)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in Piglatin. The original rule was that Piglatin had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any Piglatin code is included.
