# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-NVidia-CUDA-lang

## Description

For the development of my projects written in the NVidia CUDA language, or containing NVidia CUDA source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-NVidia-CUDA-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-NVidia-CUDA-lang)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in NVidia-CUDA. The original rule was that NVidia-CUDA had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any NVidia-CUDA code is included.
