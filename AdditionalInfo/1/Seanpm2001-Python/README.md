# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-Python

## Description

My Github organization for my Python-based projects.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Python](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Python)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in Python. The original rule was that Python had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any Python code is included.

This organization has a slight error in the title, it should be Seanpm2001-Python**-Lang** but is instead `Seanpm2001-Python`

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)
