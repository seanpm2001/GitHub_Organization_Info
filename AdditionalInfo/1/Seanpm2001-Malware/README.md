# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-malware

## Description

For the archive and development of my malicious projects, under the Seanpm2001 name. Not intended to cause harm. No ransomware allowed.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-malware](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-malware)

This organization is for malware and other malicious projects. I have no malicious intentions with these projects, and I highly recommend that they strickly be run only in a virtual machine with all the necessary precautions taken. Any code that can see that it is a virtual machine and infect outside that virtual machine is strictly prohibitied.

This organization is the Seanpm2001 brand version of the [seanwallawalla-malware](/AdditionalInfo/1/Seanwallawalla-malware/) organization.

## Extra info

For the previous organization, the ClamAV logo is the logo for this organization, as it is an anti-virus.

For this organization, I decided to use CryTux with its open body. It doesn't represent malware very well, so the icon may change soon.

Here are some virtual machine management programs that I recommend for usage (if you want to use a virtual machine, or want to test these)

* [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) - Highly recommended, owned by Oracle (originally Sun MicroSystems) and one of the top ones out there (besides VMWare) this program is open source software, but contains some necessary proprietary drivers (or else it wouldn't be able to emulate Windows or MacOS as well)

* [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/) - Also highly recommended, but requires more experience. This software is completely open source, and can emulate some operating systems that VirtualBox can't, but may require more technical experience to use.

* [Sheepshaver](https://sheepshaver.cebix.net/) - A great virtualization software that can emulate nearly any version of MacOS (down to the very first betas of the 1984 version) which in itself is really hard to do, since Apple makes it very hard to emulate Apple products on non-Apple devices. this software only works on Linux and MacOS, there is no version for Windows yet.
