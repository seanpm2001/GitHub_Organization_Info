# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-Diff-lang

## Description

For the development of my projects written with Diff. For quality control, only projects that heavily utilize Diff are included.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Diff-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Diff-lang)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in Diff. The original rule was that Diff had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any Diff code is included. For quality control, only projects that heavily utilize Diff are included. More info is available below.

### Extra notes

This organization is one of the main methods used for Git. This organization is about projects that access the method directly, so that not every single Git-based project is included.
