# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-iOS

## Description

My GitHub organization for my iOS-based projects.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-iOS](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-iOS)

This organization is used for promoting and categorizing my projects that have an iOS variant, or are based on iOS.

The icon used is for iOS 5. I normally go for iOS 6, but I didn't want it to be the same icon as my current nostalgia project icon, and also iOS 5 was likely my first version of iOS (if not 4)) also, why did I not use the Apple category? Because this is a subcategory to the Apple category that includes iOS based projects.
