# GitHub organization: SuperPower-laptops

## Description

For the development, documentation, and manufacturing of Super-powered laptops.

## More info

[https://github.com/SuperPower-laptops](https://github.com/SuperPower-laptops)

This organization is used for the development of my brand of supercomputer power laptops, or SP laptops, a high-end laptop brand that focuses on power and performance, rather than lightweight and basic. This results in a more expensive laptop that weighs over 30 pounds (rather than less than 0.5 pounds) but offers things a normal laptop can't do, such as outperforming any 9th generation (XBOX Series X/Series S, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, etc.) video game console or normal gaming computer, holding exabytes or petabytes of data, and making gaming laptops possible with a year/half-year-long battery life (while idle = 1 year, when at 50% usage = 2-6 months, when at 100% usage = 0.5-1 month)

Other unique features include wireless fast charging, support for mobile networks (5G and 6G) multi-band networking, touchscreen support, screen resolution of up to 16K (15360 × 8640) a built-in webcam with a slide cover, Hi-Fi speakers, Bluetooth support, USB 3 and USB 4 support without the use of a dongle, and much more.

The laptop will come with the Linux or BSD distribution of your choice pre-installed. A Windows or MacOS option won't be available.
