# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-GitHub

## Description

My GitHub organization for my GitHub related projects, but not directly for all projects hosted on GitHub.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-GitHub](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-GitHub)

This organization is used for the archival and development of my  GitHub related projects, but not directly for all projects hosted on GitHub. This means that just because the project is on GitHub, it doesn't belong in this category, unless it heavily utilizes GitHub or GitHub branding. If not, this would just be a duplicate of [Seanpm2001-all](/AdditionalInfo/1/Seanpm2001-all/).
