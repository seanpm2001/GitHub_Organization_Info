# GitHub organization: UnitedAutismRights

## Description

For research and awareness of Autism and sharing the viewpoints of people with Autism.

## More info

[https://github.com/UnitedAutismRights](https://github.com/UnitedAutismRights)

This organization is used for the development of the United Autism Rights (UAR) platform, which is my Autism awareness and advocacy platform, as the current top ones (Autism Speaks) do a very bad job and do not properly represent people with Autism (as someone with Autism, I would know)
