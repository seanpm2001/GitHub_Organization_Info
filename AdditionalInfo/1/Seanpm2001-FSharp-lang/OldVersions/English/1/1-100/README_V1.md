# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-FSharp-lang

## Description

My GitHub organization for my projects written in FSharp/F#.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-FSharp-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-FSharp-lang)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in FSharp/F#. The original rule was that FSharp had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any F# code is included.
