# GitHub organization: PhD-In-PHP

## Description

A place to learn and master the PHP programming language. Legal disclaimer: no actual PhD is available at the moment.

## More info

[https://github.com/PhD-In-PHP](https://github.com/PhD-In-PHP)

This organization is used for the development of my PHP education course, where you can begin to master PHP development.

**Legal disclaimer:** You cannot get an actual PhD in PHP from this course, the name is used for its own uniqueness.

Note: yes I know the logo was faking transparency, the grid pattern is part of the image, and it is not a transparent PNG file. It was the best I could get.
