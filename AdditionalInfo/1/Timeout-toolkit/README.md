# GitHub organization: Timeout-toolkit

## Description

For the development of the Timeout Toolkit extension, for managements of time outs and breaks from people, good or bad.

## More info

[https://github.com/Timeout-toolkit](https://github.com/Timeout-toolkit)

This organization is used for the development of my Timeout toolkit software addon, which is a clock add-on, and a stand alone application that helps manage time outs. Time outs are a lot more ethical than spanking or hitting, and allows your child to think about what they have done. It can also be used as a break time tool.
