# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-ASP-DOT-NET-lang

## Description

For the development of my projects written in the ASP DOT NET language, or containing ASP DOT NET source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-ASP-DOT-NET-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-ASP-DOT-NET-lang)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in ASP DOT NET. The original rule was that ASP DOT NET had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any ASP DOT NET code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

### Extra notes

This is a Microsoft DOT Net language. I chose the most nostalgic original logo, despite some of it being cut off in the organization picture.
