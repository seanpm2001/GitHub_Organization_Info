# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-Objective-J-lang

## Description

My GitHub organization for my projects written in Objective-J.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Objective-J-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Objective-J-lang)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in Objective-J. The original rule was that Objective-J had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any Objective-J code is included.
