# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-Ada-lang

## Description

For the development of my projects written in the Ada language, or containing Ada source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Ada-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Ada-lang)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in Ada. The original rule was that Ada had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any Ada code is included.

### Extra notes

The picture is slightly cropped on the GitHub organization photo, as the image isn't an exact square. Part of the top wing is missing.
