# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-Eiffel-lang

## Description

For the development of my projects written in the Eiffel programming language, or containing Eiffel source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Eiffel-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Eiffel-lang)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in Eiffel. The original rule was that Eiffel had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any Eiffel code is included.
