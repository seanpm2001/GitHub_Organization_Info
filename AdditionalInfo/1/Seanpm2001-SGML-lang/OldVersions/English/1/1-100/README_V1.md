# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-SGML-lang

## Description

For the development of my projects written in the SGML language, or containing SGML source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-SGML-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-SGML-lang)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language) The original rule was that SGML had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any SGML code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

### Extra notes

A PNG translation of the SVG logo is used, as I can't use SVG images in GitHub organization photos. The PNG is significantly lower quality, even in thumbnails. I don't entirely know why. Maybe SVG is just more flexible in this case.
