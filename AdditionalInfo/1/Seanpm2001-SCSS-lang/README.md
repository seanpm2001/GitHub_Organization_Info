# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-SCSS-lang

## Description

For the development of my projects written in the SCSS language, or containing Less SCSS source code. Not to be confused with SASS.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-SCSS-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-SCSS-lang)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in SCSS. The original rule was that SCSS had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any SCSS code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

### Extra notes

SCSS is not to be confused with SASS, which is a different language commonly confused with SCSS.
