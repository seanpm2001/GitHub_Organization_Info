# GitHub organization: SNU-Textures

## Description

For the archival and development of the SNU texturds package, that allows users to explore textures and re-texture SNU for their own use.

## More info

[https://github.com/SNU-Textures](https://github.com/SNU-Textures)

This organization is used for the archival and development of the SNU Textures package, which gives users the ability to re-texture (redesign) the SNU UI to their liking, and share their modifications with others.

## Extra notes

Note to distribution owners: this does not change the way the site looks by default, only to those who choose to re-texture the site. It will still look the way you have it set for any new user or anyone who is signed out.
