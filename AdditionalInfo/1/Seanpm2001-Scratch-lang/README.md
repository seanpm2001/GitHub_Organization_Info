# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-Scratch-lang

## Description

For the development of my projects written in the Scratch language, or containing Scratch source code. Not to be confused with the general scratch organization.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Scratch-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Scratch-lang)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in Scratch. The original rule was that Scratch had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any Scratch code is included. It is the language alternative organization for my Scratch projects, where it fits in the programming language family. Other than that, this organization is the same as [Seanpm2001-Scratch](/AdditionalInfo/1/Seanpm2001-Scratch/).

### Extra notes

This language is not to be confused with Blockly, BYOB, or Snap!
