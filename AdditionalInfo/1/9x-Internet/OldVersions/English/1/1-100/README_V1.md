## More info

[https://github.com/9x-Internet](https://github.com/9x-Internet)

This organization is used for the development of my 9x Internet suite, an old project that gave older operating systems from the 1990s (such as Windows 95, Windows 3.1, Windows 98, Windows 2000, etc.) access to the Internet safely and securely. It is a classic, legacy, old project that is far behind in development.
