# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-ReStructuredText-lang

## Description

For the development of my projects written with ReStructuredText. For quality control, only projects that heavily utilize ReStructuredText are included.

## More info

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in ReStructuredText. The original rule was that ReStructuredText had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any ReStructuredText code is included. For quality control reasons, only projects that heavily utilize ReStructuredText are included. More info is available below.

### Extra notes

ReStructuredText had to be limited, as it is a language that is expected to significantly go up in usage, and markup languages can be used alongside any language, so their usage should be limited.

I used a silver document icon as this organizations picture, as I couldn't find a logo for ReStructuredText, and the silver document had some gradient, which is good.
