This organization is used for the archival and development of an old joke project regarding the `*.pedo` file format, which started from a simple joke of `pedo file` (pedophile) to a command-line game related to the FBI. Some nude ASCII art was used in this project, but it has been censored, and it comes from characters  depicted as ages 19 and up.
