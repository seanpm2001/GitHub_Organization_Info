# GitHub organization: SNU-RSS

## Description

For the archival and development of the SNU RSS package set that enables the usage of RDF Site Summaries within SNU.

## More info

[https://github.com/SNU-RSS](https://github.com/SNU-RSS)

This organization is used for the archival and development of the place on SNU where RSS can be implemented, managed, and used.

## Extra notes

I would have just used the logo for RSS, but I wanted to keep the SNU theme going.
