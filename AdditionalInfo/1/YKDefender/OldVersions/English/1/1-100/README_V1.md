# GitHub organization: YKDefender

## Description

My GitHub organization for the development of YKDefender (Year K Defender) a set of scripts to reverse and prevent year-based bug problems, even before install.

## More info

[https://github.com/YKDefender](https://github.com/YKDefender)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my YKDefender (Year K defender) project, which is a set of scripts to reverse and prevent year-based critical system bugs (such as Y2K, Y2.01K, Y2K38, Y10K, Y32K, Y65K, etc.) it is also designed to fix these problems before the installation or usage of certain operating systems affected by these bugs, so that they can still be used in virtual machines in the future (for example, over 1000 different Linux-based ISO files are affected by the Y2K38 bug, including most versions of Android prior to 5.0, every 32 bit version of Ubuntu, Fedora, etc.)

YKDefender also has a virtual machine for modifying the time safely and quickly to prevent the system from failing due to a date bug.
