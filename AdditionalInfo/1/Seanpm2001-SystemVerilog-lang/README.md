# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-SystemVerilog-lang

## Description

For the development of my projects written in the SystemVerilog language, or containing SystemVerilog source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-SystemVerilog-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-SystemVerilog-lang)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in SystemVerilog. The original rule was that SystemVerilog had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any SystemVerilog code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

### Extra notes

I could not find a good logo for this project, so I chose the original logo but zoomed into an identifying portion. It is extremely pixelated.

I also seem to be having a difficult time correctly spelling `Verilog` and I have made many typos.
