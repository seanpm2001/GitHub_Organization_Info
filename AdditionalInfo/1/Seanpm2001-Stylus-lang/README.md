# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-Stylus-lang

## Description

For the development of my projects written in the Stylus language, or containing Stylus source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Stylus-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Stylus-lang)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in Stylus. The original rule was that Stylus had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any Stylus code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

### Extra notes

Stylus is a CSS stylesheet language. It is not to be confused with a stylus, which can mean many things, but in this sense can be confused with the computer accessory that assists with touchscreen devices.
