[https://github.com/NUNIX-dev](https://github.com/NUNIX-dev)

This organization is used for the development of the NUNIX operating system, an operating system meant to improve human and other animal functionality with cyborg technology. It is extremely early in development, and is currently mostly used for setting standards of the dos and don'ts of having control to someones brain (one key argument right now is to forbid the brain from gaining Internet Access)
