# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-Limbo-lang

## Description

For the development of my projects written in the Limbo language, or containing Limbo source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Limbo-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Limbo-lang)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in Limbo. The original rule was that Limbo had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any Limbo code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

### Extra notes

I could not find the original related logo for this project, so I chose a logo of the text `Limbo` in the format of the horror video game.
