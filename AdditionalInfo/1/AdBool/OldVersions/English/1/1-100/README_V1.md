# GitHub organization: AdBool

## Description

This organization is for the development of AdBool, the script that makes anti-adblock sites show pro-adblock and anti-adblock messages, so that you can leave.

## More info

[https://github.com/AdBool](https://github.com/AdBool)

This organization is used for the development of AdBool/AdBoolean, an activism program that manipulates websites ad packets so that an anti-adblock message will still show, but if you turn off your adblocker, it will replace it with a pro-adblock message.

This project makes bad websites that use malicious ad targeting completely unusable, and will help you avoid them.
