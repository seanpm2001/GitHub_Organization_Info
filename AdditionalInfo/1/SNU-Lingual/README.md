# GitHub organization: SNU-Lingual

## Description

For the archival and development of the SNU Lingual package, the package for language support and discussion on SNU.

## More info

[https://github.com/SNU-Lingual](https://github.com/SNU-Lingual)

This organization is used for the archival and development of the SNU Lingual package, which is a tool that gives extra language support to SNU, and also lets users discuss different languages and their usage.

## Extra notes

This tool is necessary if you want to have more than 1 language on your site. The [text engine](/AdditionalInfo/1/SNU-TextEngine/) is a better fit though, this package is going towards mostly lingual discussion.
