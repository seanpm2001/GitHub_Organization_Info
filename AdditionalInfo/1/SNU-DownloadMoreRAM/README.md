## Extra notes

**READ FURTHER IF YOU WANT TO RUIN THE JOKE**

"It is obvious, but you can't download more RAM. RAM is a hardware element, and you cannot download hardware from the Internet. If it was possible to download more RAM instead of buying it, no-one would buy it, as some people would get trillions of terabytes of RAM for free." 

   -- Captain Obvious (master of explaining the obvious)
