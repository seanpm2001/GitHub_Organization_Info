## More info

[https://github.com/SNU-SignIn](https://github.com/SNU-SignIn)

This organization is used for the archival and development of the SNU SignIn package, which is the tool that lets a user sign into the site and have an account. It is the gateway to having a userbase.

## Extra notes

This tool should always be included into the distribution, unless you don't want to have any users on your site, then it shouldn't be used (for example, if you were to just post articles but not let anybody post or edit anything)
