# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-VHDL-lang

## Description

For the development of my projects written in the Virtual Hard Disk Language (VHDL) language, or containing VHDL Style source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-VHDL-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-VHDL-lang)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in VHDL (Virtual Hard Disk Language) The original rule was that VHDL had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any VHDL code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

### Extra notes

This language is not to be confused with the VHD, VDI, VMDK, etc. file formats, although I did use a logo for the VHD file format, as I couldn't find any stock images of a detailed file icon with a detailed VHDL label.
