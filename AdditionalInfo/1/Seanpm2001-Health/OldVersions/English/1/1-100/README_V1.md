# GitHub organization: Seanwallawalla-Health

## Description

My organization for health projects. I am committed to promoting open source, functional, and life saving medical software.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanwallawalla-Health](https://github.com/Seanwallawalla-Health)

This organization is for Health projects, as I am happy to be committing open source technology to the medical field, and helping save lives without a doctors degree.

This organization is the Seanwallawalla brand version of the [Seanwallawalla-Health](/AdditionalInfo/1/Seanwallawalla-Health/) organization.

## Extra info

Legal notice: due to Red Cross logo restrictions, I used the Swiss (ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­ Switzerland) flag instead. The Red Cross/Red Crescent movement is known to be abusive when it come to their logo (which is just an inverted version of the flag of ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­ Switzerland, or ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡· Turkey. Other than that, the Red Cross/crescent movement is good) Also: my health software is designed to help, but it isn't 100% accurate and isn't a 100% guarantee in saving a life.
