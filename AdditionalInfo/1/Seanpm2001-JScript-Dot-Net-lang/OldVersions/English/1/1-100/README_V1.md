## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-JScript-Dot-Net-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-JScript-Dot-Net-lang)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written ina JScript-Dot-Net. The original rule was that JScript-Dot-Net had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any JScript-Dot-Net code is included. It is not to be confused with JavaScript or JScript.

### Extra notes

Not to be confused with JavaScript or JScript DOT Net. JScript-Dot-Net was Microsoft attempting to make JScript a DOT NET language. It didn't catch on.
