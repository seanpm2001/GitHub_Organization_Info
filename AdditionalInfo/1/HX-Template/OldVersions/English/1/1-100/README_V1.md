# GitHub organization: HX-Template

## Description

For the development of HX-Template, the duplicate and unused template finder and deleter.

## More info

[https://github.com/HX-Template](https://github.com/HX-Template)

This organization is used for the development of my old HX-template project, which finds and deletes duplicate/unused templates. The description I gave uses improper English, I kept it, as I thought the slang was fitting.
