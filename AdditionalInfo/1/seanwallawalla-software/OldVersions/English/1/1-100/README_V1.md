# GitHub organization: seanwallawalla-software

## Description

The GitHub organization for my GitHub projects that don't fall under another category/fit into multiple categories.

## More info

[https://github.com/seanwallawalla-software](https://github.com/seanwallawalla-software)

This organization is used for my software that is in a modern format. It is not to be confused with [seanpm2001-software](https://github.com/seanpm2001-software) which has the same main projects, but uses the newer branding, and is mostly the same.

This project uses the old SWW (SeanWallaWalla) branding (2015-2019) the preferred format is now SPM2001 (Seanpm2001)

This is also my very first GitHub organization.
