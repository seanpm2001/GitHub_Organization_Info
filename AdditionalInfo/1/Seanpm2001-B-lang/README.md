# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-B-lang

## Description

For the development of my projects written in the B/BCPL programming language, or containing B/BCPL source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-B-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-B-lang)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in the B/BCPL programming language. The original rule was that B had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any B/BCPL code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

### Extra notes

GitHub recognizes B/BCPL source code as Limbo code. I can see this, because these 2 bell labs languages are very similar, and Limbo is more used than B, as B was just a prototype of the C programming language. I thought that it would recognize due to the file extension, but the language is just too obscure.

I used a colorful B logo to be unique, as the B programming language did not have its own icon.
