# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-WebAssembly-lang

## Description

For the development of my projects written in the Web Assembly language, or containing Web Assembly source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-WebAssembly-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-WebAssembly-lang)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in Web Assembly. The original rule was that Web Assembly had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any Web Assembly code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

### Extra notes

I used a low quality logo for now, as I couldn't find a good skeuomorphic one.
