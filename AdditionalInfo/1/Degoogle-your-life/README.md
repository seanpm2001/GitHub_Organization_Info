# GitHub organization: Degoogle-your-life

## Description

Degoogle your life. You deserve to have privacy and to live in a Google free world.

## More info

This project is for my anti-Google articles and forks. This organization aims to be the root Degoogle marker on GitHub. I have forked all the top Degoogle projects I know of here.

These articles are written in markdown, but a project language file (normally HTML5) is included, so that they are more of a project.

Translations are under way for all articles, I hope to have it available in as many languages as possible, the 3 main targets for translation are:

* Universal and popular languages (Esperanto, English, Hindi, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Spanish, French, Portuguese, Arabic, etc.)

* Common European languages (French, German, Greek, Danish, Dutch, Norwegian, Finnish, Swedish, Icelandic, Czech, English, etc.)

* Endangered/threatened languages (Ukrainian, Myanmar, Uyghur, etc.)

These projecta are part of my public degoogling project, which started personally in 2019, and started on GitHub in February 2021.
