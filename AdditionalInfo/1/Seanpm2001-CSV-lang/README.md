# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-CSV-lang

## Description

For the development of my projects written in the CSV (Comma Separated Values) language, or containing CSV source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-CSV-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-CSV-lang)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in CSV (Comma Separated Values) The original rule was that CSV had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any CSV code is included. For quality control reasons, only projects that heavily utilize CSV are included. More info is available below.

### Extra notes

CSV was limited due to how extensively it is used on various projects. Only projects that heavily utilize CSV are included in this organization, not ones that only use CSV for documentation and miscellaneous purposes.
