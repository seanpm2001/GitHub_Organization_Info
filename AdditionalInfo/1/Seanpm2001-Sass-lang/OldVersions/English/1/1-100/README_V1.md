# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-Sass-lang

## Description

For the development of my projects written in the Sass language, or containing Sass source code. Not to be confused with SCSS.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Sass-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Sass-lang)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in Sass. The original rule was that Sass had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any Sass code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

### Extra notes

Sass is not to be confused with SCSS. Sass is a stylesheet language that translates into CSS.
