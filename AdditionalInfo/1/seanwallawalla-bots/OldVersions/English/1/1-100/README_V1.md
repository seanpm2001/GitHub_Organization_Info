## More info

This organization is used for the archival and development of my projects that are considered to be bot software. None of these are intended for malicious usage, and any unethical usage should be immediately reported to me, or someone else with the power of doing something to mitigate the issue.

This project uses the old SWW (SeanWallaWalla) branding (2015-2019) the preferred format is now SPM2001 (Seanpm2001)
