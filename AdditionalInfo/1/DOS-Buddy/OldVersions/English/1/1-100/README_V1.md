## More info

[https://github.com/DOS-Buddy](https://github.com/DOS-Buddy)

This organization is used for the development of an old project called DOS Buddy, which is a virtual assistant for the command line (CLI/Terminal) it is highly incomplete.

### Extra notes

I used a picture of Bonzi Buddy, as both projects share a last name, and (unpopular opinion?) I honestly don't dislike Bonzi Buddy in its modern form, it isn't spyware anymore, and I don't find it very annoying in general. I still wouldn't install on it on my computer outside of a virtual machine though.
