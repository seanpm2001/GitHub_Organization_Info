# GitHub organization: Slaveworks

## Description

My GitHub organization for the development of my historical game about slavery, slaveworks.

## More info

[https://github.com/Slaveworks](https://github.com/Slaveworks)

This organization is used for the development of the 3D immersive history game about slavery, where you get to play as a slave and learn the horrors of slavery. This idea may seem controversial, but it is important that these people didn't live suffering lives and die and vein, slavery still exists today, and this game aims to make anyone still supporting slavery an outcast.

The game is still very early in development, and won't be based solely on the American Civil War, it will showcase slavery across all written history, across every continent on Earth, and unfortunately maybe Mars or other planets in the future.
