# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-IntelHexBinary-lang

## Description

For the development of my projects written in the Intel Hex Binary language, or containing Intel Hex Binary source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-IntelHexBinary-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-IntelHexBinary-lang)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in IntelHexBinary. The original rule was that IntelHexBinary had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any IntelHexBinary code is included.

### Extra notes

I used the logo of an Intel Pentium 4, as it looked cool. The pentium branding was mostly cut off in the organization, as I decided to keep the highly detailed Intel logo. The picture is fully viewable in this file.
