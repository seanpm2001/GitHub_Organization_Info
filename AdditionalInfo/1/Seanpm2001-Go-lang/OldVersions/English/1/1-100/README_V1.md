# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-Go-lang

## Description

For the development of my projects written in the Go! language, or containing Go! source code. Not to be confused with Go by Google.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Go-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Go-lang)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in Go!. The original rule was that Go! had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any Go! code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

### Extra notes

Go! is the original language with the title Go, predating Googles Go by nearly 6 years. This language is the 2003 Agent based language by [Francis McCabe](https://github.com/fgmccabe) Google steamrolled over Go! with their language Go in 2009.

This project is not to be confused with my [Google Go-based projects](/AdditionalInfo/1/Seanpm2001-GoogleGo-lang/)

I couldn't find and verify a picture of the developer Francis McCabe, and since Go! doesn't have a logo, I used Francis' GitHub profile picture as the logo for this organization, although it is just a solid orange square/circle.
