# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-Verilog-lang

## Description

For the development of my projects written in the Veriolog language, or containing Verilog source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Verilog-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Verilog-lang)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in Verillog. The original rule was that Verilog had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any Verilog code is included.

### Extra notes

I could not find a good logo for this project, so I chose a low quality look-a-like.
