## More info

[https://github.com/SNU-Erotica](https://github.com/SNU-Erotica)

This organization is used for the archival and development of the SNU Erotica package, SNUs place for viewing and posting erotica, but not pornographic content. See more about the difference below. 

## Extra notes

This is different from SNU porn, as there is no intercourse involved, which is the main difference.

Examples of illegal erotica/eroge content include child erotica, rape erotica, abusive erotica, other non-ethical erotica content types. These will be placed in the [SNU evidence locker](/AdditionalInfo/1/SNU-EvidenceLocker/) and law enforcement will be notified.

You should go through sex education first before using a pornographic or sexual part of SNU. You also should be 18, but seriously, anyone with unrestricted Internet access hardly anyone follows this rule, and will find a way to bypass into the site.
