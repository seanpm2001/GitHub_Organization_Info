# GitHub organization: SNU-FontLIBrary

## Description

For the archival and development of SNUs font library, a library of digital fonts/typefaces for SNU.

## More info

[https://github.com/SNU-FontLIBrary](https://github.com/SNU-FontLIBrary)

This organization is used for the archival and development of the place on SNU where font typefaces can be browsed, downloaded, and used.

## Extra notes

The `LIB` in the word Library is uppercase on purpose, as part of my plan on educating people on what a software library is, without them fully knowing it.
