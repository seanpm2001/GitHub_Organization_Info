# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-MS-DOS-Style-lang

## Description

For the development of my projects written in the MS-DOS Style language, or containing MS-DOS Style source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-MS-DOS-Style-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-MS-DOS-Style-lang)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in MS-DOS-Style. The original rule was that MS-DOS-Style had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any MS-DOS-Style code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

### Extra notes

This language is not to be confused with the main language used in MS-DOS, this is for the MS-DOS style language. It is also not to be confused with MS-DOS (MicroSoft Disk Operating System, August 12th 1981 (as PC-DOS 1.0) to September 14th 2000, final release: MS-DOS 8.0 for Windows ME (Millennium Edition))
