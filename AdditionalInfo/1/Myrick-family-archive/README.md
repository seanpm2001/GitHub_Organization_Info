# GitHub organization: Myrick-family-archive

## More info

[https://github.com/Myrick-family-archive](https://github.com/Myrick-family-archive) **Dead link (2022.08.16)**

This organization aims to be an archive of the personal works of people in the Myrick bloodline. Currently, I am the only person contributing here, and there might be issues in the future when separating [Seanpm2001](https://github.com/seanpm2001/) from other Seans, due to the naming, and the special keywords used. These terms may be reserved or the names may change. [See my life archive project here](https://github.com/seanpm2001-lifearchive) **Dead link (2022.08.16)**

Other people/animals in the archive are there as well, but there is only 1 at te moment, which is for my familys family dog, [Guinea](https://github.com/GuineaMyrickILifeArchiveProject). **Dead link (2022.08.16)**
