# GitHub organization: SNU-2D

## Description

For development of the 2 dimensional mode of SNU.

## More info

[https://github.com/SNU-2D](https://github.com/SNU-2D)

This organization is used for the development of the 2 Dimensional mode of SNU, which is the normal functioning level of SNU usage, and is used for browsing with text, video, audio, and images. It is a step above 1 dimensional mode, but easier on memory, compared to 3D or 4D mode, where higher level graphics are forced. This mode lacks Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) functionality.
