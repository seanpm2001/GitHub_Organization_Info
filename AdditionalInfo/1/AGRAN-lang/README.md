# GitHub organization: AGRAN-lang

## Description

For the development of the AGRAN programming language.

## More info

[https://github.com/AGRAN-lang](https://github.com/AGRAN-lang)

This organization is used for the development of the AGRAN programming language project, Another old draft for a programming language, as I love playing with languges and syntax, whether it be human-spoken, or computer generated. I don't know if I will continue this project.

This project is highly incomplete and is not functional.

### Extra notes

I used the game icon for Angry Gran as the stock image for this project, but that is not what AGRAN stands for. I just chose it because of the word `gran` and `grandma` being similar. I didn't notice until now that the A makes it seem similar to this mentioned game series.
