# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-Politics

## Description

For my political projects. All opinions are my own. Not eligable for sponsors.

This organization is used for the development of my political projects on GitHub, personal projects that I limit discussion of for neutrality and peace. I can't stay silent, because that would make me complicit. Plus, there has been a political flag at my house hung by my parents for over a year now, and I can't deny it anymore, as there have been at least 300 people who saw it, either visiting us, or viewing it online.

These projects are not eligable for sponsors, due to GitHub guidelines. I don't want to profit off of them anyway, even if there wasn't a guideline. I am just trying to spread common sense.
