### Extra notes

An image of GLaDOS is used as the organization profile picture. I know that this isn't the best example, as GLaDOS is very cynical and dangerous (although she is a fictional character) but my robotics project will not turn out to be evil, I just like the character, and I didn't want to use a different generic robot icon.
