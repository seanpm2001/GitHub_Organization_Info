# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-IronPython-lang

## Description

For the development of my projects written in the IronPython language, or containing IronPython source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-IronPython-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-IronPython-lang)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in IronPython. The original rule was that IronPython had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any IronPython code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

### Extra notes

This language is not to be confused with Python, Jython, or CPython.
