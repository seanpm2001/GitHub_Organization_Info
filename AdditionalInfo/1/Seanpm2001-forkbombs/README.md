# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-forkbombs

## Description

My GitHub organization for my forkbomb projects.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-forkbombs](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-forkbombs)

This organization is used for the development of my forkbomb projects. **WARRANTY NOTICE:** These programs do not come with a warranty and may cause you to lose work if you run them. Please only run this in a virtual machine, and limit your virtual machine to a reasonable RAM limit, or else both your virtual machine and system will crash.

The organizations location is set to a forkbomb `:(){ :|:& };:` which can be easily translated to:

```shell
fork() {
    fork | fork &
}
fork
```

so don't run either script unless you are in a virtual machine.
