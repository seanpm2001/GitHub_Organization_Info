# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-Security

## Description

For the archive and development of my Security projects, under the Seanpm2001 name.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Security](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Security)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my Security related projects. It is a recreation of [seanwallawalla-Security](/AdditionalInfo/1/seanwallawalla-Security/) but with Seanpm2001 branding instead.

## Extra info

An image related to security was used but is grainy. It is better than the other option, which I considered unprofessional, according to new standards from June 8th 2021, where "cyber liquids and veins" is unprofessional, and I will work on avoiding this going forward.
