# GitHub organization: TuxBot-operating-system

## Description

For the archival and development of my operating system for my Tux robot system.

## More info

[https://github.com/TuxBot-operating-system](https://github.com/TuxBot-operating-system)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my TuxBot-operating-system project and its sub-projects.

### Extra notes

I have run out of unique, fitting pictures of Tux, so I re-used a picture of Linux for Workgroups 3.11 again. I will change the picture to a functional TuxBot if I ever get the hardware built, and if there isn't an issue with an upload cap of 1 megabyte (or whatever it might get changed to in the future)
