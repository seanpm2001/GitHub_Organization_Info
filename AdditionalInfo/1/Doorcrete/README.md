# GitHub organization: Doorcrete

## Description

My GitHub organization for my research on the anti-backdoor, anti-telemetry doorcrete security concept.

## More info

[https://github.com/Doorcrete](https://github.com/Doorcrete)

This organization is used for the discussion, research and development of my security concept doorcrete, which aims to find and remove back doors and telemetry in operating systems and other software, and fill them in with "binary concrete"

It is currently just a concept, I am not sure if it is possible to carry out.
