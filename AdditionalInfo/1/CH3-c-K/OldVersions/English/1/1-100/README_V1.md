This organization is used for the development of CH3¢K, an old open source cryptocurrency project I made in 2018 that is written in Visual Basic Script (VBS or VBScript) and Python. CH3¢K is also an old abandoned project I recently found again in 2020. It is from 2018. CH3¢K is a free and open source cryptocurrency, written in VBS and Python. The -c- instead of ¢ in the name is for technical reasons. This is one of the 12 projects I recently re-discovered in 2020.
