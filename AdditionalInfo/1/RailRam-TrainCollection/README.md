# GitHub organization: RailRam-TrainCollection

## Description

For the development of the open-source RailRam Train Collection train gameset.

## More info

[https://github.com/RailRam-TrainCollection](https://github.com/RailRam-TrainCollection)

This organization is used for the development of the RailRam train collection gameset, which is an open source set of train related games, starting with a recreation of NimbleBits Pocket Trains, and moving on to other train games later on. They will all be connected to one another in some way.

### Extra notes

I use stock images for most of my organization icons at the moment. I am heavily against flat design, and material design, and I am strongly pro-Skeuomorphism. I want to always have detail in any graphics I use. For this organization, at the moment I am using a childish train icon, as it was the closest I could get to Skeuomorphism. I will do almost anything to promote and use Skeuomorphism, even if I have to use infant-like graphics.
