# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-ActionServerPages-lang

## Description

For the development of my projects written in the Classic ASP/Action Server Pages language, or containing Classic ASP/Action Server Pages source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Raku-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Raku-lang)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in Action Server Pages, now known as Classic ASP. The original rule was that Action Server Pages had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any Action Server Pages code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

### Extra notes

This language was originally called Microsoft Action Server Pages, or Microsoft ASP. It is now known commonly as Classic ASP, as it was superceded by ASP Dot Net.
