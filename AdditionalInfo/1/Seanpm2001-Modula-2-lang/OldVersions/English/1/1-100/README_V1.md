# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-Modula-2-lang

## Description

My GitHub organization for my projects written in Modula 2 or containing Modula 2 code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Modula-2-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Modula-2-lang)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in Modula-2. The original rule was that Modula-2 had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any Modula-2 code is included.

### Extra notes

A GIF is used for this organizations photo. It had to be cropped to fit in the square frame, but the original is in this folder. Of course it is not an animated GIF, as that is not supported in a GitHub profile picture yet. I was surprised that GIF was supported in general, it will still be nice when SVG is supported.

I had to use a non-fully related image, as I couldn't find the official logo for Modula-2.
