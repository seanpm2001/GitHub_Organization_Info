# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-Scala-lang

## Description

My GitHub organization for my Scala-based projects.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Scala-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Scala-lang)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in Scala. The original rule was that Scala had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any Scala code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)
