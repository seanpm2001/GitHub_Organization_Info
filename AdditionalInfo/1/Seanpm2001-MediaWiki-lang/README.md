# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-MediaWiki-lang

## Description

For the development of my projects written with MediaWiki. For quality control, only projects that heavily utilize MediaWiki are included.

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in MediaWiki. The original rule was that MediaWiki had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any MediaWiki code is included. For quality control reasons, only projects that heavily utilize MediaWiki are included. More info is available below.

### Extra notes

I refuse to use the new April 1st 2021 MediaWiki logo, as it is terrible, and makes MediaWiki not unique. It is now just another generic logo, of which no notable recognition can be found. I will always use the sunflower logo instead. It should have just stayed an April fools joke and not an official thing.

MediaWiki had to be limited, as it is a language that is expected to significantly go up in usage, and markup languages can be used alongside any language, so their usage should be limited.
