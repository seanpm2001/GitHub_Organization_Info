My GitHub organization for the development of the Linux Defender security suite.

## More info

[https://github.com/seanpm2001/Linux_Defender](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Linux_Defender)

This organization is used for the development of the Linux Defender security suite program I have been developing, which is an alternative anti-virus to Linux from ClamAV. It contains more customization options, and higher user friendliness. It is written in Shell and Python and is early in development.
