# GitHub organization: V-Reshot

## Description

My GitHub organization for the development of the V Reshot screenshot virtual machine.

## More info

[https://github.com/V-Reshot](https://github.com/V-Reshot)

This organization is used for the development of V-Reshot (Virtual ReScreenshot) which is a screenshot virtual machine used to rebuild screenshots through patterns to save memory. It was developed due to an issue I increased with the global number of screenshots taking up too much memory. This project is still early in development.
