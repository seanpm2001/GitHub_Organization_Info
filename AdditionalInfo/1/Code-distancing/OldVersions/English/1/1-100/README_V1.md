# GitHub organization: Code-distancing

## Description

For my COVID-19 awareness and humor repository, code distancing, and its continued development.

## More info

[https://github.com/Code-distancing](https://github.com/Code-distancing)

This organization is used for the development of the code distancing project, which is one of my most developed joke programs that also doubles as an awareness program for COVID-19, what to do, and how to stay safe, vaccinated or still waiting for a vaccination, it gives helpful advice. I hope it can remain somewhat relevant after the pandemic ends.
