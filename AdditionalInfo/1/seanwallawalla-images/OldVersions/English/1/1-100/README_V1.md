# GitHub organization: seanwallawalla-tools

## Description

A GitHub organization for my image projects.

## More info

[https://github.com/seanwallawalla-images](https://github.com/seanwallawalla-images)

This organization is used for the archival and development of my image projects that are used as stock images for any ethical purpose, including machine learning. I hope to be a suitable alternative to unsplash (post 2017) and other non-free image sites.

This project uses the old SWW (SeanWallaWalla) branding (2015-2019) the preferred format is now SPM2001 (Seanpm2001)
