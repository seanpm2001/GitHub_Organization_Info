# The AdditionalInfo compilation

I have been thinking lately, and I decided that I will make a compilation of the additionalInfo directory. Due to GitHub truncation at 1000 items, this directory will be a little bit more difficult to search through unmodified GitHub.

Currently, the best method for this is to download it and view it untrucated.

The other way you can do so while still being on GitHub is to find an organization in [`1`](/AdditionalInfo/1/), [`2`](/AdditionalInfo/2/), or [`3`](/AdditionalInfo/3/) and enter the following path in your search bar:

```
https://github.com/seanpm2001/GitHub_Organization_Info/tree/main/AdditionalInfo/Compilaion/GitHub_Organization_Info/Additional/<name-of-organization>/
```
