# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-JavaScriptPlusPlus-lang

## Description

For the archival and development of my projects written in the JavaScript++ programming language, or containing JavaScript++ source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-JavaScriptPlusPlus-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-JavaScriptPlusPlus-lang/)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in JavaScriptPlusPlus. The original rule was that JavaScriptPlusPlus had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any JavaScriptPlusPlus code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

## Extra info

I couldn't find a good logo for JavaScript++ so for now, I am just using a highly detailed JavaScript icon from the old days. It may be replaced in the future.
