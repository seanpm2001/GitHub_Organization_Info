# GitHub organization: DeciCube-Concept

## Description

This is the organization for the DeciCube as a concept. For the development side, see https://github.com/DeciCube/

## More info

[https://github.com/DeciCube-Concept](https://github.com/DeciCube-Concept/)

This project hosts archives and developments of the project DeciCube, a research project into a maximum capacity storage device, which is estimated to be capable of holding over 500 million copies of the entire 2021 Internet (or 500 geopbytes (500 nonillion bytes))

## Extra info

The DeciCube is a research project.

Currently, only the ZFS and OpenZFS file systems are capable of handling this device. The intended device is a 128 bit Quantum computer. See the speciifcation for more info.

This project is written in Markdown.

This projects name stands for Decillion, or Decillion cube (1 Decillion is equal to 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000)

This project currently uses a generic cube as its logo.

To prevent cybersquatting, I have taken an additional domain for this project. It is mirrored from the original [`DeciCube`](https://github.com/DeciCube/)

This organization is going to be separate from the original, as this is just for the concept. If actual engineering and construction begins, that will take place at [DeciCube](https://github.com/DeciCube/) and not here.

The home repository for this project lies at [seanpm2001/DeciCube](https://github.com/seanpm2001/DeciCube/)
