# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-History

## Description

The Seanpm2001 GitHub organization for digital history related projects. Not to be confused with [@seanpm2001-historian](/AdditionalInfo/2/Seanpm2001-Historian/)

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-History](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-History/)

This project hosts archives and developments of my projects related to the History foundation and its projects.

## Extra info

This project is for search history, browsing history, and related projects. It is NOT for actual history projects.

This organization is currently empty, as I am unable to fork projects at the moment.
