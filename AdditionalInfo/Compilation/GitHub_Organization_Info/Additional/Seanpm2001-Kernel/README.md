# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-Kernel

## Description

The Seanpm2001 GitHub organization for software/operating system kernel related projects and forks.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Kernel](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Kernel/)

This project hosts the development and archival of projects and forks related to software and operating system kernels.

## Extra info

This is a category project.

I am using a generic kernel icon for this project that looked unique, I didn't use Tux, as that would be too unoriginal (it is already in use in a lot of my projects)

<!--
As of 2022, May 27th, I don't have any projects that use for this organization yet.

Due to my inability to fork GitHub repositories outside of my own account at the moment, this organization is empty.

The homepage for this project is located [`here (unavailable, there is no current home repository for this project)`](https://www.example.com)
