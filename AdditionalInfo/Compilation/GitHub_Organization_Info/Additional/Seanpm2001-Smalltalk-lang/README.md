# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-Smalltalk-lang

## Description

For the development of my projects written in the Smalltalk language, or containing Smalltalk source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Smalltalk-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Smalltalk-lang)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in SmallTalk. The original rule was that SmallTalk had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any SmallTalk code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

### Extra notes

This is about the programming language, not the smalltalk as in the informal language of trying to start/keep a conversation going.
