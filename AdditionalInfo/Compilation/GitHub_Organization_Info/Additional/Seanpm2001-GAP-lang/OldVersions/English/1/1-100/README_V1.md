For the archival and development of my projects written in the GAP programming language, or containing GAP source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-GAP-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-GAP-lang/)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in GAP. The original rule was that GAP had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any GAP code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

## Extra info

The logo in use is for GAP 4.x.
