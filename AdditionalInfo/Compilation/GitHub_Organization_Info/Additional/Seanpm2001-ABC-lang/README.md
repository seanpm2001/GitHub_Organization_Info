# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-ABC-lang

## Description

For the development of my projects written in the ABC language, or containing ABC source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-ABC-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-ABC-lang)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in ABC. The original rule was that ABC had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any ABC code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

### Extra notes

ABC is a very old programming language that heavily inspired the Python project language.

I used the logo of the ABC company, from 2013. I feel it fits best.
