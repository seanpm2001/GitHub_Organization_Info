# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-Raku-lang

## Description

For the development of my projects written in the Raku language, or containing Raku source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Raku-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Raku-lang)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in Raku. The original rule was that Raku had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any Raku code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

### Extra notes

Raku is commonly used on my Japanese/Anime related projects, due to Raku being/close to a Japanese word.
