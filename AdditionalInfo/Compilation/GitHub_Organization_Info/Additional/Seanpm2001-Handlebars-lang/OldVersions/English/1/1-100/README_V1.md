# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-Handlebars-lang

## Description

For the development of my projects written in the Handlebars language, or containing Handlebars source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Handlebars-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Handlebars-lang)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in Handlebars. The original rule was that Handlebars had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any Handlebars code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

### Extra notes

This project is for sorting projects written in the Handlebars language, a subset of MoustacheBars, a JavaScript template language.

Due to images with the logo, a 3rd or less of the logo made it into the GitHub profile picture.

This is not to be confused with handlebars, which help people not fall/help people walk in difficult areas.
