# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-Svelte-lang

## Description

For the archival and development of my projects written in the Svelte programming language, or containing Svelte source code.

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Svelte-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Svelte-lang/)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in the Svelte programming language. The original rule was that Svelte had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any Svelte source code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

Svelte is a recognized language by GitHub, as of 2022 February 25th.
