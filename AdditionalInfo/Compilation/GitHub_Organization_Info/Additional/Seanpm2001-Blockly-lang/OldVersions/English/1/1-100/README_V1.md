# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-Blockly-lang

## Description

For the development of my projects written in the Blockly language, or containing Blockly source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Blockly-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Blockly-lang)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in Blockly. The original rule was that Blockly had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any Blockly code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

### Extra notes

This language is not to be confused with Scratch, BYOB, or Snap!
