# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-QML-lang

## Description

For the development of my projects written in the QML language, or containing QML source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-QML-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-QML-lang)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in QML. The original rule was that XSL/XSLT had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any QML code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

### Extra notes

QML stands for **Q**T **M**odeling **L**anguage. It is a stylesheet editor for the QT framework.
