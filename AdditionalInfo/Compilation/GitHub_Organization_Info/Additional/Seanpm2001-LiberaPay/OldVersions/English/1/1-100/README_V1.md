# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-LiberaPay

## Description

For the archival and development of my LiberaPay related projects.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-LiberaPay](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-LiberaPay/)

This project hosts archives and developments of my work related to the LiberaPay donation and community platform.

## Extra info

This project is still a work in progress.

As of 2021 November 22nd, I still am not accepting donations on my funding platforms, as I still don't have a wallet set up.

This project uses 2 icons. I couldn't use the original, as GitHub doesn't allow SVG images in profile pictures, and the original image is in SVG format. I exported it to PNG, but kept both versions. You can use the dropdowns to show/hide the preferred one. The raster (PNG) version is hidden by default.
