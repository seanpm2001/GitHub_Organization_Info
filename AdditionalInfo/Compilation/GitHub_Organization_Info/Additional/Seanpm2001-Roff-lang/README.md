# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-Roff-lang

## Description

For the archival and development of my projects written in the Roff programming language, or containing Roff source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Roff-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Roff-lang/)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in Roff. The original rule was that Roff had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any Roff code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

## Extra info

I could not find a logo for the Roff programming language, so I choose a generic variant of the letter R.
