# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-V-lang

## Description

For the archival and development of my projects written in the V programming language, or containing V source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-V-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-V-lang/)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in V. The original rule was that V had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any V code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

## Extra info

This project uses 2 icons. I couldn't use the original, as GitHub doesn't allow SVG images in profile pictures, and the original image is in SVG format. I exported it to PNG, but kept both versions. You can use the dropdowns to show/hide the preferred one. The raster (PNG) version is hidden by default.
