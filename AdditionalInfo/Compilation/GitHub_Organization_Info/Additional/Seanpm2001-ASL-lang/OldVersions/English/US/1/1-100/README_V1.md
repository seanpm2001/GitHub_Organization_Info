# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-ASL-lang

## Description

For the archival and development of my projects written in the ASL programming language, or containing ASL source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-ASL-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-ASL-lang/)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in the ASL programming language. The original rule was that ASL had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any ASL source code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

## Extra info

ASL is the name of the language.

I had a long search for the logo of this language, but was unable to find it, due to such a high saturation of ASL (**A**merican **S**ign **L**anguage) results. I used the logo of the Illumos project, as it is the first project I have encountered that uses ALS in its software.

<!--The logo currently in use is in GIF format, but is not animated. !-->

I don't know what ASL stands for, in the sense of programming languages.
