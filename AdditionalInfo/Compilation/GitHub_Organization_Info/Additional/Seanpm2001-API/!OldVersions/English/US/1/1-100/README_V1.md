# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-API

## Description

The Seanpm2001 GitHub organization for API (Application Programming Interface) projects.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-API](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-API/)

This project hosts archives and developments of my API (**A**pplication **P**rogramming **I**nterface) projects

## Extra info

The Firefox profile used to develop this organization today had Android as the theme, as Android research is what led me to first discover the term API.

This organization is currently empty, as I am unable to fork projects at the moment.
