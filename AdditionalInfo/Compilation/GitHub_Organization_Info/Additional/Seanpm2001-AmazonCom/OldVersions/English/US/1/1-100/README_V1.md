My GitHub organization for my projects and forks related to the Amazon.com company.

## More info

[https://AmazonComhub.com/Seanpm2001-AmazonCom](https://AmazonComhub.com/Seanpm2001-AmazonCom/)

This project hosts archives and development regarding projects related to the Amazon.com web technologies company.

## Extra info

Amazon.com is both the name of the company and the name of the companys home website (homepage)

Since `.` isn't allowed in the name, I just combined Amazon and Com like so: `AmazonCom`
