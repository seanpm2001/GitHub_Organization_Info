# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-Encryption

## Description

The Seanpm2001 GitHub organization for software and media projects related to Oracle VM Encryption (previously: SunMicroystems Encryption)

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Encryption](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Encryption/)

This project hosts projects in the field of digital encryption software and tools.

## Extra info

This is a category project.

[AZWS-Encryption](/AdditionalInfo/2/AZWS-Encryption/) will be included here, even though it technically isn't encryption.

The logo for this project comes from an unknown source, it is a fair use encryption icon that I was able to find an SVG variant for.

Due to issues with GitHub, this organization is currently empty, as I can't fork projects here at the moment.
