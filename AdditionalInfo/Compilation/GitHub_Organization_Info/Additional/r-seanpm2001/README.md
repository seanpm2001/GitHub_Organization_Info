# GitHub organization: r-seanpm2001

## Description

The GitHub organization for the seanpm2001 subreddit, located at https://www.reddit.com/r/seanpm2001/

## More info

[https://github.com/r-seanpm2001](https://github.com/r-seanpm2001/)

This project hosts archives and developments of my personal Reddit subreddit, located at [r/seanpm2001](https://www.reddit.com/r/seanpm2001/)

## Extra info

This project uses the first subreddit logo as its logo, which is a very fancy, crystal version of Tux (Linux mascot)

This project is written mostly in YAML at the moment.

The `/` can't be added to the name for obvious reasons, and is substituted with `-`

This project is separate from [seanpm2001-reddit](/AdditionalInfo/1/Seanpm2001-reddit/) as it hosts content for just this subreddit, and not others.

The home repository for this project lies at [seanpm2001/r-seanpm2001](https://github.com/seanpm2001/r-seanpm2001/)
