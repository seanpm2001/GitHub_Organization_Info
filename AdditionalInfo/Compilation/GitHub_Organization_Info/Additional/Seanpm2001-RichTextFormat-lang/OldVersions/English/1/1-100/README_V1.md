# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-RichTextFormat-lang

## Description

For the development of my projects written in the Rich Text Format language, or containing Rich Text Format source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-RichTextFormat-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-RichTextFormat-lang)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in Rich Text Format. The original rule was that Rich Text Format had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any Rich Text Format code is included. For quality control reasons, only projects that heavily utilize Rich Text Format are included. More info is available below.

### Extra notes

Rich Text Format was limited due to how extensively it is used on various projects. Only projects that heavily utilize XML are included in this organization, not ones that only use Rich Text Format for documentation and miscellaneous purposes.
