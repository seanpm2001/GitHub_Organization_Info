# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-Swift-lang

## Description

My GitHub organization for my Swift-based projects.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Swift-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Swift-lang)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in Swift. The original rule was that Swift had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any Swift code is included.
