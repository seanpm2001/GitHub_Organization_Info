# GitHub organization: Green-Star-OS

## Description

A research project into North Koreas Red Star OS, and a set of themes for making a Red Star OS clone.

## More info

[https://github.com/Green-Star-OS](https://github.com/Green-Star-OS/)

This project hosts archives and developments of the project Green Star OS, a research project into North Korean technology/North Korea in general, along with theming files for creating a Red Star OS replica on UNIX. Please note that despite the term OS being used, this isn't an operating system.

## Extra info

Disclaimer: This is not an Operating System. Plans originally developed for an Operating System, but a desktop theme seemed better.

This project is written in Lua and MoonScript.

Aside from the theming, this project is also a research project and knowledge base into North Korean society and technology.

This project classifies as a political research project, and thus a political project, and is delisted from my other projects. It may or may not be eligable for sponsors.

I am using a green star as the logo, as I don't want to invoke this being Red Star OS, or related to Communism.

The home repository for this project lies at [seanpm2001/Green-Star-OS](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Green-Star-OS/)

This project was originally private in its early developments, but was made public on 2022, Friday, April 8th after officially launching its parent organization.
