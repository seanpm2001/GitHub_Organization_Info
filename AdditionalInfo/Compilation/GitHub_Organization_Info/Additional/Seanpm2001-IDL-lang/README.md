# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-IDL-lang

## Description

For the archival and development of my projects written in the IDL programming language, or containing IDL source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-IDL-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-IDL-lang/)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in the IDL programming language. The original rule was that IDL had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any IDL source code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

## Extra info

IDL is the name of the language.

I don't know where to find the original logo for this language, as it may not have one, so I found a wordmark with the text `IDL` and some graphing graphics to go with it.

IDL is a recognized language by GitHub, as of 2022 February 25th.

<!--The logo currently in use is in GIF format, but is not animated. !-->

I don't know what IDL stands for, in the sense of programming languages.

No other extra info available.
