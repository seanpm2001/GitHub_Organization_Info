This logo is not in use, as it is 100x100 pixels smaller than the current one (400x400 pixels) however, I hope for a SVG version in the future.

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in the ReasonML programming language. The original rule was that ReasonML had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any ReasonML source code is included.

## Extra info

<details open><summary><p lang="en">Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section</p></summary>

ReasonML is the name of the language, although GitHub recognizes it as just `Reason`

ReasonML is a recognized language by GitHub.

I found 2 logos for this language, one was slightly smaller than the other, and both are raster JPEG files. I hope to get an SVG version for display in the future.

The current logo in use is in JPEG format. This means that it is not transparent, but it does not need replacement without a solid white background.

ReasonML programs have the `.re` and `.rei` file extensions.

ReasonML was developed by a former Facebook employee, but the language has no direct connection to Facebook.

The official GitHub organization for ReasonML is located at [ReasonML](https://github.com/reasonml/)

<!-- I currently cannot figure out what file extension ReasonML programs use. !-->

<!-- The logo currently in use is in GIF format, but is not animated.!-->

<!--I don't know what ReasonML-lang stands for, in the sense of programming languages. !-->

No other extra info is currently available.
