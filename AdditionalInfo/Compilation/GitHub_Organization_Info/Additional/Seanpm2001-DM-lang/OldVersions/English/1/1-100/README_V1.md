# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-DM-lang

## Description

For the archival and development of my projects written in the DM programming language, or containing DM source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-DM-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-DM-lang/)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in DM. The original rule was that DM had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any DM code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

## Extra info

I couldn't find the source repository for this language, and I couldn't find an icon either. It is a new language I just found out about. It seems to be specific to 1 video game.

A generic "DM" logo is in use here.

Not to be confused with private messaging (Direct Message, DM)
