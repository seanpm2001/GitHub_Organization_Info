# GitHub organization: uOffice

## Description

My GitHub organization for my development of an open source office suite.

## More info

[https://github.com/uOffice](https://github.com/uOffice)

This organization is used for the development of my office suite software, uOffice. Designed due to some limitations with existing services (such as the 512 megabyte document limit, not being able to put videos into documents (links to videos on the Internet don't count) and not enough customization) it can be used as an alternative to LibreOffice, Open Office, Apple Pages, Microsoft Office, Google Office (Google Docs, Google Sheets, Google Drawings, etc.) etc.
