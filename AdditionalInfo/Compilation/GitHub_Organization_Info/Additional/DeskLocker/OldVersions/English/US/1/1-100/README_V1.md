# GitHub organization: DeskLocker

## Description

The GitHub organization for the DeskLocker software tool. Lock parts of your desktop and unlock them with ease when needed.

## More info

[https://github.com/DeskLocker](https://github.com/DeskLocker/)

This project hosts archives and developments of my project known as DeskLocker. It locks parts of your desktop with the click of a button, and unlocks them the same way.
 
## Extra info

This project was created out of frustration by the inability to toggle the `set image as wallpaper` button, which constantly caused problems, and crashes. Since the software is not in a developed state, I am still having this problem.

This project is written mostly in Python at the moment.

The home repository for this project lies at [seanpm2001/DeskLocker](https://github.com/seanpm2001/DeskLocker/)
