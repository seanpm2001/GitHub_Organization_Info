The development organization for my open source video game projects.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanwallawalla-Gaming](https://github.com/Seanwallawalla-Gaming)

This organization is used for my software that is in application format. It is not to be confused with [Seanpm2001-gaming](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Gaming) which has the same main projects, but also contains images and external project data related to the games, their inspirations, and other games.

This project uses the old SWW (SeanWallaWalla) branding (2015-2019) the preferred version is now SPM2001 (Seanpm2001)
