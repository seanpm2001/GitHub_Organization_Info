# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-WTFPL-License

## Description

My GitHub organization for my projects licensed under the Do What The Fuck You Want To Public License (WTFPL) software license.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-WTFPL-License](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-WTFPL-License/)

My GitHub organization for my projects licensed under one of the do What The Fuck you want Public License (WTFPL) software licenses.

## Extra info

This is a category project.

There were no square versions of the WTFPL license easily accessible/findable online, so I made one .I quickly created a logo graphic in GIMP for this project. The project file is located [here](/AdditionalInfo/2/Seanpm2001-WTFPL-License/WTFPL_License_Project_300x300.xcf) and the uncompressed version is located [here](/AdditionalInfo/2/Seanpm2001-WTFPL-License/WTFPL_License_NoCompression_300x300.png) additionally, the original wide graphic can be found [here](/AdditionalInfo/2/Seanpm2001-WTFPL-License/WTFPL_Wide1.jpeg), and the original SVG variant can be found [here](/AdditionalInfo/2/Seanpm2001-WTFPL-License/WTFPL_logo.svg).

This project is only for WTFPL licensed projects under the following licenses:

| License (SPDX) | License name |
|----|----|
| [`WTFPL`](https://spdx.org/licenses/WTFPL.html) | `Do What The F*ck You Want To Public License` |

Either version 1 or version 2. SPDX doesn't separate the two

The only exception is the usual global repositories (such as the current repository `GitHub_Organization_Info` which is licensed under the GNU General Public License V3.0) and projects that give licensing info.
