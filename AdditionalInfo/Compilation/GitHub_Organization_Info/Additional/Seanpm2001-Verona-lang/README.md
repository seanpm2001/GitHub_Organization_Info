# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-Verona-lang

## Description

For the archival and development of my projects written in the Verona programming language, or containing Verona source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Verona-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Verona-lang/)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in Verona. The original rule was that Verona had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any Verona code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

## Extra info

I am using a Emacs variant of the icon, as there doesn't seem to be an official icon for this language yet.

Verona is an experimental concurrency programming language by Microsoft. As of 2021 Saturday November 27th, it is still very early in development.
