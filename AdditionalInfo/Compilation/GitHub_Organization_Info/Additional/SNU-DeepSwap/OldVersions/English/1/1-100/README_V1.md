# GitHub organization: SNU-DeepSwap

## Description

For development of DeepSwap, SNU's ethical deepfake client.

## More info

[https://github.com/SNU-DeepSwap](https://github.com/SNU-DeepSwap)

This organization is used for the archival and development of SNUs ethical deepfake client, DeepSwap, aimed at ethical deepfakes through consent, and for a functional DeepFake client on a non-Windows system. Along with this, a trusted source will be needed in future when we reach the uncanny valley of deepfakes, so we should get that in order first.
