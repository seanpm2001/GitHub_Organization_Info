## Extra notes

I am deeply concerned with the environment and I am actively looking for ways to remove greenhouse gas emission from the Cryptocurrency mining process. My latest idea is a bit expensive, but it is to mine Cryptocurrency in space, at least 500 kilometers away from the Earths most outer atmosphere. This is just an idea, and I would like to see some research on this, as it may cost more, but it is better than destroying our precious planet and the beautiful and priceless life that lives on it.

NFT stands for Non Fungible Tokens.
