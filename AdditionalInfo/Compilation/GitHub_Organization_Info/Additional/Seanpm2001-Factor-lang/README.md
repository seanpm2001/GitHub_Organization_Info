# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-Factor-lang

## Description

For the archival and development of my projects written in the Factor programming language, or containing Factor source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Factor-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Factor-lang/)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in Factor. The original rule was that Factor had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any Factor code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

## Extra info

Factor doesn't have a transparent logo, so I went with the closest factorial symbol I could find. A better icon can be added in the future.
