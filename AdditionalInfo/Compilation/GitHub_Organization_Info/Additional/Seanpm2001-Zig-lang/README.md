For the archival and development of my projects written in the Zig programming language, or containing Zig source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Zig-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Zig-lang/)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in Zig. The original rule was that Zig had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any Zig code is included.
