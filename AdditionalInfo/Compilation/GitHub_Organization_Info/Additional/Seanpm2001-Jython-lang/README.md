# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-Jython-lang

## Description

For the development of my projects written in the Jython language, or containing Jython source code. Not to be confused with Python.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Jython-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Jython-lang)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in Jython. The original rule was that Jython had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any Jython code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

### Extra notes

This language is not to be confused with Python or CPython.

The picture was slightly cut off in the organization, I made sure to include the main logo, but text was cut off so that only `Jyt` and part of the `h` was visible. `hon` was cut out.
