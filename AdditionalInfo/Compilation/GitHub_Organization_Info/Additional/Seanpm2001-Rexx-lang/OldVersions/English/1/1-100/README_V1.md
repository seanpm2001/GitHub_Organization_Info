# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-Rexx-lang

## Description

For the archival and development of my projects written in the REXX programming language, or containing REXX source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Rexx-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Rexx-lang/)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in Rexx. The original rule was that Rexx had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any Rexx code is included.

## Extra info

None.
