# GitHub organization: WacOS-wOS

## Description

The GitHub organization for wOS, an open source remake of iOS (iOS 4 and up, for iPhoneOS 1-3, see [@WhyPhoneOS](/AdditionalInfo/2/WhyPhoneOS/)) Part of the WacOS operating system project.

## More info

[https://github.com/WacOS-wOS](https://github.com/WacOS-wOS/)

This project hosts the archival and development of my project, wOS, which is a subsystem of the WacOS project that aims to imitate/recreate the iOS series of Apple operating systems. It is currently very early in development, and is not functional yet.

## Extra info

This is not a category project.

The logo for this project is a custom logo, consisting of the `wOS` logomark across a blue sky wallpaper.

This project covers iOS 4 and up. iPhoneOS 1 to 3 is supported in the separate project [`@WhyPhoneOS`](/AdditionalInfo/2/WhyPhoneOS/)

Due to my inability to fork GitHub repositories outside of my own account at the moment, this organization is currently empty.

The homepage for this project is located [`here (seanpm2001/wOS`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS-wOS/)
