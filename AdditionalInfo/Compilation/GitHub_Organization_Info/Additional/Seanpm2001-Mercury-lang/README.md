# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-Mercury-lang

## Description

For the archival and development of my projects written in the Mercury programming language, or containing Mercury source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Mercury-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Mercury-lang/)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in the Mercury programming language. The original rule was that Mercury had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any Mercury source code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

## Extra info

Mercury is the name of the language. It was likely named after either one or more of the following 3-4 entities: Mercury (Planet) Mercury (Chemical element) Mercury (Roman God) although it may also be named after musician Freddie Mercury. It also could be something else, I am not sure.

Mercury is a recognized language by GitHub, as of 2022 February 25th.
