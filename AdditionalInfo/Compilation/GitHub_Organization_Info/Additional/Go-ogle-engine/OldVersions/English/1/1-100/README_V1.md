## More info

[https://github.com/Go-ogle-engine](https://github.com/Go-ogle-engine)

This organization is used for the development of the Degoogled Google search-based engine, Go!ogle, which is written in Go! and not Go. This project was created out of spite of Google steamrolling a language back in 2009, and revealing to the world that they were becoming evil.

This project likely isn't going to go anywhere, and isn't needed. It is kept for legacy reasons, and may have some tinkering done to it.
