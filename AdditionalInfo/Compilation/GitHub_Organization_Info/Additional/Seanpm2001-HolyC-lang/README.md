# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-HolyC-lang

## Description

For the archival and development of my projects written in the HolyC programming language, or containing HolyC source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-HolyC-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-HolyC-lang/)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in the Holy C programming language. The original rule was that Holy C had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any Holy C source code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

## Extra info

Holy C is the name of the language.

Holy C is a recognized language by GitHub.

The Holy C language is a dialect of C written by the former programmer Terry A. Davis, which he used to create the Christian operating system, TempleOS, an entire operating system written from the ground up. Terry A. Davis suffered from schizophrenia, and died in 2018 after getting hit by a train. He was a controversial figure in programming, but he was extremely skilled and talented, he wasn't just creating another Linux distribution, he built an entire operating system from the ground up by himself. RIP Terry A. Davis.

The current logo in use is in JPEG format. This means that it is not transparent, but it still looks good in light or dark mode, due to how it is laid out.

Terry A. Davis insisted that 16 color (4 bit) graphics were the way to go. They really aren't bad.

TempleOS is an operating system that Terry A. Davis used to talk with God.

Terry A. Davis is slightly controversial due to usage of the N word, worrying about `"the CIA N*****s"` along with other things, but the community has pretty much gotten over it, remember, he suffered from mental problems. The Internet accomodated itself for him.

Terry deserved better. It is unfair what schizophrenia did to him.

HolyC programs have the `.HC` file extension.
