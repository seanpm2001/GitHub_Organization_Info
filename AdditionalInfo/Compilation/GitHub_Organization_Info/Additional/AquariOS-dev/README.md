# GitHub organization: AquariOS-dev

## Description

AquariOS is a lightweight operating system for managing and automating your fishtank/aquarium. Part of @Project-Aquarius

## More info

[https://github.com/AquariOS-dev](https://github.com/AquariOS-dev/)

This project hosts archives and developments of the AquariOS project, a mini operating system project for managing and automating a fishtank/aquarium. It relies on TinyOS, and is written mostly in nesC and Verilog.

## Extra info

The name was already taken, but I was unaware until creating the organization. It has been planned for weeks, so I went with it.

The 2 projects that came before have become completely abandoned and have not been touched in years:

[AquariOS](https://github.com/AquariOS/) [AquariOS-Backup](https://github.com/AquariOS-backup/)

They are also for completely different purposes, so I feel we can make an agreement if a conflict ever arises.

This project uses a generic stock image of an aquarium with a goldfish in it (for now) it may be changed in the future.

This project is part of [Project Aquarius](/AdditionalInfo/2/Project-Aquarius/)

The home repository for this project lies at [seanpm2001/AquariOS](https://github.com/seanpm2001/AquariOS/)
