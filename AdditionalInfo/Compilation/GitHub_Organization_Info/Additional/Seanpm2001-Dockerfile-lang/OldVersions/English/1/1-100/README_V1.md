# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-Dockerfile-lang

## Description

For the development of my projects written in the Docker file language, or containing Dockerfile source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Dockerfile-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Dockerfile-lang)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in Dockerfile. The original rule was that Dockerfile had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any Dockerfile code is included.

## Extra info

None.
