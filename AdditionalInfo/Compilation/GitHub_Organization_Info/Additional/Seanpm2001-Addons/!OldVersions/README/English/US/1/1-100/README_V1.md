# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-Addons

## Description

The Seanpm2001 GitHub organization for software addon projects.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Addons](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Addons/)

This project hosts archives and developments of my projects in the field of Addons and Addons software, a very niche platform.

## Extra info

This project is for browser and program addons. It is not to be confused with [Seanpm2001-Plugins](/AdditionalInfo/2/Seanpm2001-Plugins/)

This project uses a colorful puzzle piece logo, as the puzzle piece is commonly associated with addons.

This organization is currently empty, as I am unable to fork projects at the moment.
