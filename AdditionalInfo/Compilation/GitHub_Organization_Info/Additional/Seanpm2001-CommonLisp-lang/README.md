# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-CommonLisp-lang

## Description

For the development of my projects written in the Common Lisp language, or containing Common Lisp source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-CommonLisp-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-CommonLisp-lang)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in Common Lisp. The original rule was that Common Lisp had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any Common Lisp code is included.
