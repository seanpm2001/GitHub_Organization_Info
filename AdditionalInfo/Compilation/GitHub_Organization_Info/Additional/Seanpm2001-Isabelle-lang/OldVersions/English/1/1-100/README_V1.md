# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-Isabelle-lang

## Description

For the development of my projects written in the Isabelle language, or containing Isabelle source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Isabelle-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Isabelle-lang)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in Isabelle. The original rule was that Isabelle had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any Isabelle code is included.

### Extra notes

I could not find a good logo for this project, so since this is for a theorem proof assistant, I chose a mathematical theorem that most middle schoolers and onward would understand (or anyone who knows the basics of Algebra, I chose to target middle schools, as that is the general age where a lot of people get into programming, myself included) which is the Pythagorean Theorem, or A[squared] plus B[Squared] equals C[Squared]. I feel that it is a fitting icon.
