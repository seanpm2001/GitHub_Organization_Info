# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-Clojure-lang

## Description

For the development of my projects written in the Clojure language, or containing Clojure source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Clojure-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Clojure-lang)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written ina Clojure. The original rule was that Clojure had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any Clojure code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

### Extra notes

A PNG translation of the SVG logo is used, as I can't use SVG images in GitHub organization photos.
