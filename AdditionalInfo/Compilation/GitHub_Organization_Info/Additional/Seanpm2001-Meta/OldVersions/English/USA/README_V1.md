# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-Meta

## Description

The Seanpm2001 GitHub organization for meta projects and forks (Not for Facebook projects)

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Meta](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Meta/)

This project hosts the archival and development of projects and forks that are meta (but not by Facebook, which I don't support its usage of the name meta and refuse to allow official association with that name, not even as `Meta Platforms`)

## Extra info (part 1)

This is a category project.

The logo for this project is a generic meta wordmark. I had to scale it to 256px, as the original image wasn't square.

### Meta definition

[From Wikipedia: Meta (Revision 1094526168)](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Meta&oldid=1094526168)

#### General definition

Meta (from the Greek `μετά`, meta, meaning "after" or "beyond") is a prefix meaning "more comprehensive" or "transcending."

#### Epistemic definition (Epistemology)

In epistemology, and often in common use, the prefix meta- is used to mean about (its own category). For example, metadata are data about data (who has produced them, when, what format the data are in and so on). In a database, metadata are also data about data stored in a data dictionary and describe information (data) about database tables such as the table name, table owner, details about columns, – essentially describing the table. Also, metamemory in psychology means an individual's knowledge about whether or not they would remember something if they concentrated on recalling it. The modern sense of "an X about X" has given rise to concepts like "meta-cognition" (cognition about cognition), "meta-emotion" (emotion about emotion), "meta-discussion" (discussion about discussion), "meta-joke" (joke about jokes) and "metaprogramming" (writing programs that write programs). "Metagaming" accordingly, means game about game. However, it has a different meaning depending on the type of game. In role-playing games, this means that someone with a higher level of knowledge is playing, i.e. that the player incorporates factors that are outside the actual framework of the game. The player has knowledge that was not acquired through the play and experience in the game, but was obtained from external sources. This type of metagaming is often frowned upon in many role-playing game communities because it impairs game balance and equality of opportunity. Metagaming can also refer to a game that is used to create or change the rules while playing the game. You can play this kind of metagame and choose which rules apply during the game itself. So you have the possibility, among other things, to adjust or increase the level of difficulty. Such metagame include et al. campaign role-playing games like Halo 3. Complex card - or board games, e.g. poker or chess, are also called as metagame.  According to Nigel Howard is this kind of metagame defined as a decision-making process that is derived from the analysis of possible outcomes in relation to external variables that change a problem.[

In a rule-based system, a metarule is a rule governing the application of other rules.

#### Etymolic definition (Etymology)

The prefix comes from the Greek preposition and prefix meta- (`μετα-`), from `μετά`, which meant "after", "beside", "with", "among" (with respect to the preposition, some of these meanings were distinguished by case marking). Other meanings include "beyond", "adjacent" and "self", and it is also used in the forms `μετ-` before vowels and `μεθ-` "meth-" before aspirated vowels.

##### History (Etymology)

The earliest form of the word "meta" is the Mycenaean Greek me-ta, written in Linear B syllabic script. The Greek preposition is cognate with the Old English preposition mid "with", still found as a prefix in midwife. Its use in English is the result of back-formation from the word "metaphysics". In origin Metaphysics was just the title of one of the principal works of Aristotle; it was so named (by Andronicus of Rhodes) because in the customary ordering of the works of Aristotle it was the book following Physics; it thus meant nothing more than "[the book that comes] after [the book entitled] Physics". However, even Latin writers misinterpreted this as entailing metaphysics constituted "the science of what is beyond the physical". Nonetheless, Aristotle's Metaphysics enunciates considerations of natures above physical realities, which one can examine through this particular part of philosophy, for example, the existence of God. The use of the prefix was later extended to other contexts based on the understanding of metaphysics to mean "the science of what is beyond the physical".
