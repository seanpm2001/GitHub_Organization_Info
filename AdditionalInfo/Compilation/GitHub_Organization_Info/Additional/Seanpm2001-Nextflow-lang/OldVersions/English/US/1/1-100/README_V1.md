This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in the Nextflow programming language. The original rule was that Nextflow had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any Nextflow source code is included.

## Extra info

<details open><summary><p lang="en">Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section</p></summary>

Nextflow is the name of the language.

Nextflow is a recognized language by GitHub.

I couldn't find a logo for this language, so I am using a generic "flow" wordmark with an icon that somewhat resembles NeXT (or next)

The current logo in use is in JPEG format. This means that it is not transparent, but it does not need replacement without a solid white background.

Nextflow programs have the `.nf` file extension.

The official GitHub organization for Nextflow is located at [nextflow-io](https://github.com/nextflow-io/)

> Link to the home repository [nextflow-io/nextflow](https://github.com/nextflow-io/nextflow/)

<!-- I currently cannot figure out what file extension Nextflow programs use. !-->

<!-- The logo currently in use is in GIF format, but is not animated.!-->

<!--I don't know what Nextflow-lang stands for, in the sense of programming languages. !-->

No other extra info is currently available.
