# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-VimScript-lang

## Description

For the development of my projects written in the VimScript language, or containing VimScript source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-VimScript-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-VimScript-lang)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in Vim Script. The original rule was that VimScript had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any VimScript code is included.
