## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Gherkin-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Gherkin-lang)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in Gherkin. The original rule was that Gherkin had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any Gherkin code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

## Extra info

The language is also known as cucumber.io
