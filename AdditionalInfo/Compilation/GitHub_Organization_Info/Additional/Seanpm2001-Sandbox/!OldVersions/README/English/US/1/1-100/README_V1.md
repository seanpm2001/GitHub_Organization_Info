# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-Sandbox

## Description

The Seanpm2001 GitHub organization for project testing in a sandbox environment.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Sandbox](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Sandbox/)

This project hosts projects that are sandbox test projects (projects where things can be tested, without causing damage to the final project or experience)

## Extra info

This is a category project.

There was another recognizable sandbox icon I could have used, but I chose my 2nd option (there were 2 sandbox icons I chose between, [context](/OrganizationGraphics/ByDate/2022/May/20/))

Due to issues with GitHub, this organization is currently empty, as I can't fork projects here at the moment.
