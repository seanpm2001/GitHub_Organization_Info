# GitHub organization: StealthGeo

## Description

The alternative GitHub organization for the stealth Geo Font specification, a font designed to be a mix of analog and digital, in a stealthy fashion.

## More info

[https://github.com/StealthGeo](https://github.com/StealthGeo/)

This project hosts the development and archival of the StealthGeo fontface. It is a duplicate (mirror) of [`StealthGeo-Font`](/AdditionalInfo/2/StealthGeo-Font/)

## Extra info

This is not a category project.

This project uses a detailed font icon for its logo. It uses a different one than its predecessor. Both of the current ones in use do not represent the source project.

This project is for archives and developments of the StealthGeo typeface, a font I designed that is a mix of analog and digital, with a hint of stealth. No curves are used in this font.

<!--
As of 2022, May 27th, I don't have any projects that use for this organization yet.
!-->

Due to my inability to fork GitHub repositories outside of my own account at the moment, this organization is currently empty.

The home repository for this project, lies at [seanpm2001/StealthGeo-Font](https://github.com/seanpm2001/StealthGeo-Font/)
