# GitHub organization: AcroSlideX

## Description

The GitHub organization for the AcroSlideX software LIBrary, a basic library for making acronyms slide. Collapse and expand acronyms. 

## More info

[https://github.com/AcroSlideX](https://github.com/AcroSlideX/)

This project hosts archives and developments of the AcroSlideX project.

## Extra info

The logo in use is the letter A with a striped pattern. I wanted a logo that reflected sliding, and this is as close as I could get.

The home repository for this project is located at [seanpm2001/AcroSlideXLIBrary](https://github.com/seanpm2001/AcroSlideXLIBrary/)

The X in the name is a fancy letter, it has undedicated symbolism (symbolism with no defined purpose yet)

This organization is currently empty, as I am unable to fork projects at the moment.
