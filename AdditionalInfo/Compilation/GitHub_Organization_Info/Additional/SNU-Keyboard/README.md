# GitHub organization: SNU-Keyboard

## Description

For the archival and development of the built-in SNU keyboard.

## More info

[https://github.com/SNU-Keyboard](https://github.com/SNU-Keyboard)

This organization is used for the archival and development of the main Keyboard of SNU, used on certain devices, and containing unique features. It is cross-compatible with operating systems beyond the SNU framework (it works outside of SNU as well)

## Extra notes

Not very useful if you already have a physical keyboard, but still can be enabled on laptops and desktops. A bonus of this is built-in multi-linqual and Unicode support.
