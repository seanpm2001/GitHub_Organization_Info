This project is for archives and developments of the subproject of BathHouseOS, known as SankOS, which is a sink operating system.

## Extra info

This project uses a generic blue glossy faucet logo. It may be changed in the future.

The name [`SankOS`](https://github.com/Sankos/) was already taken, but was in use by a user not making use of the name.

This project is a subproject of the [@bathhouseos](/AdditionalInfo/2/BathHouseOS/) project.

The description was cut off due to a character limit. The last line should read:

```plain-text
Written in nesC and Verilog, designed for TinyOS.
```

Since I can't fork projects at the moment, this organization is currently empty.

The home repository for this project, lies at [seanpm2001/SankOS](https://github.com/seanpm2001/SankOS/)
