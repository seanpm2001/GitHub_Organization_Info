# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-Stats

## Description

The Seanpm2001 GitHub organization for statistical related projects and forks.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Stats](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Stats/)

This project hosts the development and archival of projects and forks related to statistics.

## Extra info

This is a category project.

I am using a glossy, detailed statistics logo for this project, although it has a white background that needs to be removed.

This project has the same guidelines as [`Seanpm2001-Statistics`](/AdditionalInfo/2/Seanpm2001-Statistics/)

<!--
As of 2022, May 27th, I don't have any projects that use for this organization yet.
!-->

Due to my inability to fork GitHub repositories outside of my own account at the moment, this organization is empty.

The homepage for this project is located [`here (unavailable, there is no current home repository for this project)`](https://www.example.com)
