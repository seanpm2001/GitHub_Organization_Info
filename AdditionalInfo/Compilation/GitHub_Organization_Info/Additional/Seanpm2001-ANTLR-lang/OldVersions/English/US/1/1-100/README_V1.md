# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-ANTLR-lang

## Description

For the archival and development of my projects written in the ANTLR programming language, or containing ANTLR source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-ANTLR-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-ANTLR-lang/)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in the ANTLR programming language. The original rule was that ANTLR had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any ANTLR source code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

## Extra info

ANTLR is the name of the language.

ANTLR is a recognized language by GitHub.

The ANTLR language is mostly written in Java. It is a computer-based language recognition language.

I am using a logo in PNG format with the wordmark. I decided against using the wordmark-free version, because this version is higher quality, and also contains a wordmark for better recognition.

<!-- The current logo in use is in JPEG format. This means that it is not transparent, but it needs a replacement without a solid white background. !-->

ANTLR programs have the `.g4` file extension.

<!-- The logo currently in use is in GIF format, but is not animated.!-->

<!--I don't know what ANTLR-lang stands for, in the sense of programming languages. !-->

No other extra info available.
