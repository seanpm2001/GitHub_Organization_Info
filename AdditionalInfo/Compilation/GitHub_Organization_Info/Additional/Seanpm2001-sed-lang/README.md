# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-sed-lang

## Description

For the archival and development of my projects written in the sed programming language, or containing sed source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-sed-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-sed-lang/)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in the sed programming language. The original rule was that sed had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any sed source code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

## Extra info

sed is the name of the language.

I don't know where to find the original logo for this language, as it may not have one, so I found a wordmark with the text `sed` with some applied graphics.

sed is a recognized language by GitHub, as of 2022 February 25th.

The name of the language is all lower-case, including the first letter.

<!--The logo currently in use is in GIF format, but is not animated. !-->

I don't know what sed stands for, in the sense of programming languages.

No other extra info available.
