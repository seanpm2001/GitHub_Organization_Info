# GitHub organization: Seanspokane2015

## Description

For the archival and development of projects associated with my original online username (succeeded by: seanwallawalla)

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanspokane2015](https://github.com/Seanspokane2015/)

This project hosts the development and archival of projects and forks related to projects I made under my original username (@seanspokane2015) which was used only for my [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/seanspokane2015/) account (my first public and posting social media account, starting 2015 March 2nd)

## Extra info

This is a category project.

I am using an extremely low quality `SeanWallaWalla` icon, as it was the last one used on my Scratch account. A higher quality variant is available, but not on me. It may be added in the future.

Example projects include the [Scratch master repository](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Scratch_Master/)

<!--
As of 2022, May 27th, I don't have any projects that use for this organization yet.
!-->

Due to my inability to fork GitHub repositories outside of my own account at the moment, this organization is empty.

The homepage for this project is located [`here (unavailable, there is no current home repository for this project)`](https://www.example.com/)
