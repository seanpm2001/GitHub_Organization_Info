# GitHub organization: MalNotch

## Description

The organization for MalNotch, the second piece of Notchware, meant to replace the notched part of your screen with NSFW/NSFL patterns.

## More info

[https://github.com/MalNotch](https://github.com/MalNotch/)

This project hosts the archival and development of my project, MalNotch, which is the second piece of Notchware. It is meant to replace the section of your screen that is covered by a notch with NSFW (Not Safe For Work) / NSFL (Not Safe For Life) patterns. It is an activism piece against hardware notches, as someone who unknowingly has this on their device and uploads screenshots/screen recordings will not typically notice the pattern until after upload, which can lead to an account takedown. Luckily, [FloweredNotch](https://github.com/FloweredNotch/) can counteract it.

## Extra info

This is not a category project.

The logo for this project is a black square emoji with a skull in the center, meant to resemble the doom, gloom, and other not nice patterns being placed over the notched section of your screen.

This project contains 2 sub-projects:

- 1. [seanpm2001/MalNotch](https://github.com/seanpm2001/MalNotch/)
- 2. [seanpm2001/Notchware](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Notchware/)
<!-- - 3. [seanpm2001/FloweredNotch](https://github.com/seanpm2001/FloweredNotch/) !-->

Due to my inability to fork GitHub repositories outside of my own account at the moment, this organization is currently empty.

The homepage for this project is located [`here (seanpm2001/MalNotch`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/MalNotch/)
