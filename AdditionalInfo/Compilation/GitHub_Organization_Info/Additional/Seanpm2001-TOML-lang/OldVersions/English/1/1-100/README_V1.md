# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-TOML-lang

## Description

For the development of my projects written with TOML. For quality control, only projects that heavily utilize TOML are included.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-TOML-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-TOML-lang)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in TOML. The original rule was that TOML had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any TOML code is included. For quality control reasons, only projects that heavily utilize TOML are included. More info is available below.

### Extra notes

TOML had to be limited, as it is a language that is expected to significantly go up in usage, and markup languages can be used alongside any language, so their usage should be limited.
