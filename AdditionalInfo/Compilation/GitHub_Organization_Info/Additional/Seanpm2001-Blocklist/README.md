# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-Blocklist

## Description

For the archival and development of my blocklist/blocklist extension to be added to other blocklists.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Blocklist](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Blocklist/)

This organization is used for the archival and development of my blocklist project, a small blocklist extension to major blocklists for restricting access to certain projects of mine that may not be suitable in certain schools, businesses, institutions, countries, or territories.

## Extra info

Projects have to either contain swears, a reference to sexuality, or malicious source code to be added to the list.

I consider malware to be a form of art, and I produced some unique malware with unique payloads that is meant to only be run in a virtual machine. Newer standards for my malware now include pro-virtual machine source code.

Projects with sexuality contain references to sexuality but do not contain sexual imagery, video, or audio.
