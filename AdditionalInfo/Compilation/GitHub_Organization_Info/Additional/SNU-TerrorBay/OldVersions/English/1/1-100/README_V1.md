This organization is used for the archival and development of the SNU Terror Bay, a place for the historical archive of terror content for SNU. It is not meant to be a place of promoting terrorism, just archiving it. That being said, terrorist threats should not be made here, and will result in significant legal consequences for the perpetrator doing so.
