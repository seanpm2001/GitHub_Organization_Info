# GitHub organization: AUTOMATE-2001

## Description

For the archival and development of the Seanpm2001 workflow automation software tool called AUTOMATE-2001.

## More info

[https://github.com/AUTOMATE-2001](https://github.com/AUTOMATE-2001/)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my personal workflow automation tool titled AUTOMATE-2001. It is designed for personal use, but if you have a similar workflow, it can help automate your projects as well.

## Extra info

This project is intended for use of automating repetitive tasks. I have ruled that it would take over 4x less time to automate the project than to continue doing it manually. It is my second software automation project.

This project has a simple name, the word automate, plus the year at the end of my username ([@seanpm**2001**](https://github.com/seanpm2001/)) which is also by birth year.

Due to the year being set to 2001, I decided to make this projects community theme be centered around 2001: A Space Odyssey, and the subsequent books and films. As such, HAL 9000 is the logo for this project.
