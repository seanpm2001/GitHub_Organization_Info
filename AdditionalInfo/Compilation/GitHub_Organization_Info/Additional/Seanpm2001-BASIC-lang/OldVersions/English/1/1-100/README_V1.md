# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-BASIC-lang

## Description

For the development of my projects written in the BASIC programming language, or containing BASIC source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-BASIC-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-BASIC-lang)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in BASIC. The original rule was that BASIC had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any BASIC code is included.

### Extra notes

An image of a Commodore 64 was used for this organizations photo, as it came pre-installed with BASIC, was a key step in promoting the BASIC programming language, and was the best selling personal computer of all time. The image is in GIF format, I had to choose a small image due to GitHubs 1 megabyte profile picture limit.
