# GitHub organization: WichCraft-dev

## Description

The organization for the archival and development of WichCraft, a powerful FLOSS sandwich crafting and managing software.

## More info

[https://github.com/WichCraft-dev](https://github.com/WichCraft-dev/)

This project hosts the archival and development of the WichCraft software piece, a sandwich crafting and sandwich/burger/sub business management software currently written in Gherkin.

## Extra info

This is not a category project.

[`Wichcraft`](https://github.com/Wichcraft/) was already taken.

I have a custom logo in use for this project. The PNG is the one in use, although an SVG version exists. SVG version was created with Inkscape. I am not very good with Inkscape yet, I merely imported the binary file into the vector editor, and had it convert it to SVG. Due to this, it is still the same quality level, and looks blurry when zooming. It is also not a W3C valid SVG, and takes up more space than the PNG version. Any suggestions on how I can do a better job using Inkscape are welcome.

I am considering rewriting this project, as it may not be possible to use Gherkin as intended, but I will try as hard as I can first. It is extremely disappointing, as using Gherkin was one of the main reasons I greenlit this project

Due to my inability to fork GitHub repositories outside of my own account at the moment, this organization is currently empty.

The homepage for this project is located [`here (seanpm2001/WichCraft)`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WichCraft/)
