# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-ShaderLab-lang

## Description

For the archival and development of my projects written in the ShaderLab programming language, or containing ShaderLab source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-ShaderLab-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-ShaderLab-lang/)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in ShaderLab. The original rule was that ShaderLab had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any ShaderLab code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

## Extra info

I discovered this language via GitHub.

ShaderLab is a Unity language and doesn't appear to have its own icon, so I used a glossy version of the Unity logo.

<!-- ShaderLab doesn't have an official logo, so I used the best alternative I could find. !-->
