# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-Euphoria-lang

## Description

For the archival and development of my projects written in the Euphoria programming language, or containing Euphoria Image source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Euphoria-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Euphoria-lang/)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in the Euphoria programming language. The original rule was that Euphoria had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any Euphoria source code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

## Extra info

Euphoria is the name of the language. It is not to be confused with the [emotion of Euphoria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euphoria/)

Euphoria is a recognized language by GitHub.

The language can also be called OpenEuphoria.

Euphoria is sometimes confused with the [Elixir](/AdditionalInfo/1/Seanpm2001-Elixir-lang/) programming language by GitHub.
