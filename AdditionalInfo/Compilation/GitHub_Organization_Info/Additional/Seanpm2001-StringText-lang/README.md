# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-StringTemplate-lang

## Description

For the archival and development of my projects written in the StringTemplate programming language, or containing StringTemplate source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-StringTemplate-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-StringTemplate-lang/)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in the StringTemplate programming language. The original rule was that StringTemplate had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any StringTemplate source code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

## Extra info

StringTemplate is the name of the language.

StringTemplate is a recognized language by GitHub, although only 2 projects are currently written only in this language, or with a majority of source code in the language.

The logo I am using is low quality `128x128` but it is the official logo.

GitHub is a bit finnicky and weird with this language, recognizing it in the Linguist graph, but claiming that no such files exist in this language beyond that.

<!-- The current logo in use is in JPEG format. This means that it is not transparent, but it needs a replacement without a solid white background. !-->

StringTemplate files use the `.st` file extension, the same as SmallTalk.

<!-- The logo currently in use is in GIF format, but is not animated.!-->

<!--I don't know what StringTemplate-lang stands for, in the sense of programming languages. !-->

No other extra info available.
