# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-Seed7-lang

## Description

For the development of my projects written in the Seed7 language, or containing Seed7 source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Seed7-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Seed7-lang)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in Seed7. The original rule was that Seed7 had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any Seed7 code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

### Extra notes

I couldn't find an icon for this language, nor a good image of seeds, so I chose an image of the numeral 7.
