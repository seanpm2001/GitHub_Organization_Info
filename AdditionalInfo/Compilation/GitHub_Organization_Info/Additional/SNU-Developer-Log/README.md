# GitHub organization: SNU-Developer-Log

## Description

Home of the SNU Developer log, a log of SNUs development history. 2D mode (original): https://github.com/seanpm2001/SNU_2D_DeveloperLog

## More info

[https://github.com/SNU-Developer-Log](https://github.com/SNU-Developer-Log/)

This project hosts archives and developments of the SNU Developer log project, the place on SNU where development notes are logged and documented for site updates. The other half is at the [update log](/AdditionalInfo/2/SNU-Update-Log/)

## Extra info

The SNU Developer Log is a documentation project.

This project is written mostly in HTML5.

This project currently uses the original SNU Developer log logo from the project as the organization logo. This image was made in MS-PAINT 10.0.

I originally forgot to create an organization for this project, as I seem to have overlooked it originally.

The home repository for this project lies at [seanpm2001/SNU_2D_DeveloperLog](https://github.com/seanpm2001/SNU_2D_DeveloperLog/)
