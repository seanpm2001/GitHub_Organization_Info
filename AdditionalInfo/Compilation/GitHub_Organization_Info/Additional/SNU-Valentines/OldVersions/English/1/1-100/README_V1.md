## More info

This organization is used for the archival and development of the SNU Valentines package, SNUs holiday page for Valentines Day and the valentines who celebrate it.

## Extra notes

For the organization name, the word `Day` was excluded from `Valentines Day` as I felt valentines was a better fit.
