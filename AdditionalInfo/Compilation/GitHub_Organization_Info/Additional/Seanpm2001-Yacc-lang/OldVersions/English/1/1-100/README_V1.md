# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-Yacc-lang

## Description

For the development of my projects written in the Yacc language, or containing Yacc source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Yacc-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Yacc-lang)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in Yacc. The original rule was that Yacc had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any Yacc code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

### Extra notes

Yacc doesn't have an official logo, so I used a low quality (150x150) square icon of the GCC compiler anniversary logo.
