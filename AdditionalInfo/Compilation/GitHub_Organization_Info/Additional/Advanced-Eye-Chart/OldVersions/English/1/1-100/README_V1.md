## More info

[https://github.com/Advanced-Eye-Chart](https://github.com/Advanced-Eye-Chart)

This organization is used for the development of my Optometrist software, Advanced Eye Chart, which is a highly advanced, open source, enterprise eye chart software. It is still early in development. Compared to a normal eye chart, it has extra benefits, like multi-lingual support, exporting and printing eye charts, customizing, setting appointments, and more. It is the ultimate Opotype software.

It is also written in Python.
