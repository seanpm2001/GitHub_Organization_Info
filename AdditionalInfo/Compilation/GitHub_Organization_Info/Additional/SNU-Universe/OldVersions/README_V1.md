# GitHub organization: SNU-Universe

## Description

For the archival and development of the SNU Universe project, a place to explore the known universe right through your web browser.

## More info

[https://github.com/SNU-Universe](https://github.com/SNU-Universe)

This organization is used for the archival and development of the SNU Universe package, SNUs place for exploring a map of the known universe (including Earth, Mars, Jupitor, the Milky Way, the Andromeda Galaxy, and much more) right through your web browser.

## Extra notes

Currently, only a 3D variant of the project exists. If possible, the SNU dimensional converter will make a 2D version in the future, if it meets the guidelines of conversion. There will never be a 1D, or 0D variant. There will be a 4D variant though.

The dimensional mode of the project is not included in the organization name, as it is not necessary. Also, there will be multiple dimensional modes mirrored here, so it would be counter-productive, as I would then need to make SNU-2D-Universe, SNU-3D-Universe, SNU-4D-Universe, and so on for every single SNU project. The only organizations with the dimensions in its name are the dimension organizations themselves, which (SNU-2D for example) includes a mirror of every 2D SNU project.
