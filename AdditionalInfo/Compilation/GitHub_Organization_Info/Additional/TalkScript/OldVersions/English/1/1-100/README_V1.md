# GitHub organization: TalkScript

## Description

My GitHub organization for the development of the TalkScript programming language.

## More info

[https://github.com/TalkScript](https://github.com/TalkScript)

This organization is for the development of the TalkScript programming language, which came from an older idea I had for a programming language IDE that works entirely through voice, so people who are blind, or have no arms can program, or even people who just want to program by simply talking script.
