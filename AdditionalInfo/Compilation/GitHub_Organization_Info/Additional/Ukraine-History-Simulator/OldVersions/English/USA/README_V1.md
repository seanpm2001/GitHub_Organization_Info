# GitHub organization: Ukraine-History-Simulator

## Description

The GitHub organization for UHS (Ukraine History Simulator) a simulator game where you can control Ukraine at any point in its history.

## More info

[https://github.com/Ukraine-History-Simulator](https://github.com/Ukraine-History-Simulator/)

This project hosts the archival and development of the Ukraine History Simulator project, a history game that goes over the entire history of Ukraine (from pre-history 45000 BCE to the present day)

## Extra info

This is not a category project.

I have a custom logo in use for this project. Somehow, when creating version 1, I forgot to include the `Tryzub` (Ukraines historic and symbolic trident logo) it was added in version 2. I am considering making a row of all Ukrainian flags at the top and bottom of the text in version 3.

This game is still in the planning process. It includes data for the 2022 Russian Invasion of Ukraine, but it may not be implemented immediately, as it is too soon, and data is coming in so fast that the data isn't concrete yet (currently, data for the first 2 months is concrete, and can be added, but not for 2022 May and later)

This game includes a WW2 era segment, there are plenty of WW2 history games, I don't know how many let you control Ukraine. This period is controversial, due to Nazism, and it is still being decided upon if any graphics will be used here (I am not going to use the uncensored Nazi flag on GitHub, as it isn't appropriate, although it is history)

The game is currently written in GDScript.

Due to my inability to fork GitHub repositories outside of my own account at the moment, this organization is currently empty.

The homepage for this project is located [`here (seanpm2001/Ukraine-History-Simulator)`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Ukraine-History-Simulator/)
