This organization is used for the development of the Ratiyo analytics and statistics translation tool, which translates analytics and statistics across social and blog platforms. To put it simply, it is a tool for personal website analytics that can translate the worth of followers/subscribers across platforms (In example: sites like GitHub where it is harder to get followers: 7 GitHub followers to x YouTube subscribers, where it is not too uncommon to have thousands of subscribers, etc.) it is still early development.
