# GitHub organization: FORTRAN-Fortress

## Description

The Seanpm2001 GitHub organization for FORTRAN Fortress, a Fortran sandbox and playground, written entirely in Fortran

## More info

[https://github.com/FORTRAN-Fortress](https://github.com/FORTRAN-Fortress/)

This project hosts the development and archival of the project `FORTRAN Fortress` which is a place to test FORTRAN source code, and make use of it.

## Extra info

This is not a category project.

I am using a generic logo of a purple castle. I wanted to get an image of a small purple tower to resemble a Fortress, but I couldn't find one. This image has some problems, such as a black bar at the top.

The project within this project is written entirely in Fortran
