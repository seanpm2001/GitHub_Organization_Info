# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-GitLab

## Description

The Seanpm2001 GitHub organization for GitLab related projects, but NOT for GitLab mirrors.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-GitLab](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-GitLab/)

This project hosts archives and developments of my projects related to the GitLab website. It is not to be used just for projects of mine that were mirrored to GitLab.

## Extra info

This is a category project.

I am using a high quality (2K) image of the GitLab logo with a white background. In the future, it should be replaced with a transparent version.

GitLab is similar to GitHub, but is a different site, has a different owner (Atlassian) has different content on it, but it also uses the Git version control system, and several features that GitHub has.

This organization is only for projects related to GitLab development. Since I intend to mirror my projects to GitLab in the future, it is important to note that this organization is NOT solely for projects that were mirrored to GitLab, but projects that heavily relate to/depend on GitLab.
