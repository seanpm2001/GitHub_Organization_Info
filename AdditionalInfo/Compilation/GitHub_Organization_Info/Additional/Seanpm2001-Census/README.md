# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-Census

## Description

For the archival and development of my Census data projects.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Census](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Census)

This organization is used for the archival and development of my Census data projects, which are projects that hold certain census data developed by me.

## Extra info

I used a logo that contains binary gender symbols. I don't have any good skeuomorphic image that I can use to represent Census data. If you don't like the use of binary gender symbols and want the logo to be more inclusive right now, you can help by helping me draw a new skeuomorphic image to use. I don't have any graphic design knowledge with the current graphic design software installed on my machine (as of June 25th 2021) and would love help getting a new logo, as I don't feel this one fits very well. If the logo is to be redrawn, I don't want any genders to be represented, as that is not the type of census data I am collecting. I would also prefer an SVG to be used if recreated.
