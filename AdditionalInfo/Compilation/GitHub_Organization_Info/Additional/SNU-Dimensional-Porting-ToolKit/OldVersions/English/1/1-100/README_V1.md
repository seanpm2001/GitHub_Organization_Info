# GitHub organization: SNU-Dimensional-Porting-ToolKit

## Description

For the archival and development of the SNU Dimensional Converter, or SNU Dimensional Porting ToolKit.

## More info

[https://github.com/SNU-Dimensional-Porting-ToolKit](https://github.com/SNU-Dimensional-Porting-ToolKit/)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my SNU-Dimensional-Converter project, which is a tool used to ease the development of multi-dimensional SNU modules, so that SNU 2D modules don't have to be manually rewritten for 1D, 3D, or 4D mode, and vice versa.

## Extra info

This project is far from complete, but when ready, it will revolutionize SNU development and take years off the development time per person.

The original project name was `SNU Dimensional Porting ToolKit` but I shortened it to `SNU-Dimensional-Converter` I still prefer the pre-latter name.
