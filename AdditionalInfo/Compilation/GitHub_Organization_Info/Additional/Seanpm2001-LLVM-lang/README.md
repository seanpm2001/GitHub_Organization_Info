# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-LLVM-lang

## Description

For the archival and development of my projects written in the LLVM programming language, or containing LLVM source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-LLVM-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-LLVM-lang/)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in LLVM. The original rule was that LLVM had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any LLVM code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

## Extra info

LLVM is a compiler collection, but it is also its own programming language.
