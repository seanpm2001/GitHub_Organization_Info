This organization is used for the archival and development of the SNU Digg Mode package, SNUs place for emulating/recreating various versions of the Digg website, especially the pre-v4 versions.

## Extra notes

V4 of Digg was a complete redesign of the site which was highly unliked, and caused Reddit to serve as an alternative, which grew exponentially. Digg, like MySpace, is still up and running and has some users, but isn't as popular anymore (demise start date: August 25th 2010)
