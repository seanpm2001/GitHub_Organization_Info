# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-M-lang

## Description

For the archival and development of my projects written in the M programming language, or containing M source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-M-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-M-lang/)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in M. The original rule was that M had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any M code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

## Extra info

I discovered this language via GitHub.

M doesn't have an official logo as far as I can tell (before researching) so I used the best alternative I could find at the time.

The actual language name is MUMPs (Massachusetts General Hospital Utility Multi-Programming System), but it is commonly referred to as M by GitHub. There is a debate to its actual name.
