# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-BitBucket

## Description

The Seanpm2001 GitHub organization for BitBucket related projects, but NOT for BitBucket mirrors.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-BitBucket](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-BitBucket/)

This project hosts archives and developments of my projects related to the BitBucket website. It is not to be used just for projects of mine that were mirrored to BitBucket.

## Extra info

This is a category project.

I am using a semi-high quality (512x512) image of the BitBucket logo with a transparent background. Due to how basic the BitBucket logo is, the file is only 4,501 bytes in size (also note that it is in PNG format, and not SVG. The SVG version would likely be under 1 kilobyte in size)

BitBucket is similar to GitHub, but is a different site, has a different owner, has different content on it, but it also uses the Git version control system, and several features that GitHub has.

This organization is only for projects related to BitBucket development. Since I intend to mirror my projects to BitBucket in the future, it is important to note that this organization is NOT solely for projects that were mirrored to BitBucket, but projects that heavily relate to/depend on BitBucket.
