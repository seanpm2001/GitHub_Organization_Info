This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in the Dafny programming language. The original rule was that Dafny had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any Dafny source code is included.

## Extra info

Dafny is the name of the language

Dafny is a recognized language by GitHub.

Dafny is a mathematical proofing programming language.

The current logo in use is in JPG format. This means that it is not transparent, but it does not need background color replacement. I am using the official Dafny logo, which is not a full square. A lower quality, square version is used above.

Dafny programs have the `.dfy` file extension.

The official GitHub organization for Dafny is located at [Dafny-lang](https://github.com/dafny-lang/)

<!-- I currently cannot figure out what file extension Dafny programs use. !-->

<!-- The logo currently in use is in GIF format, but is not animated.!-->

<!--I don't know what Dafny-lang stands for, in the sense of programming languages. !-->

No other extra info is currently available.
