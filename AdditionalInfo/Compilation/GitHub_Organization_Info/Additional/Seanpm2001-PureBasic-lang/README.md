# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-PureBasic-lang

## Description

For the archival and development of my projects written in the PureBasic programming language, or containing PureBasic source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-PureBasic-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-PureBasic-lang/)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in PureBasic. The original rule was that PureBasic had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any PureBasic code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

## Extra info

I couldn't find a logo for PureBasic, so I used an image of a PureBasic CD-ROM.
