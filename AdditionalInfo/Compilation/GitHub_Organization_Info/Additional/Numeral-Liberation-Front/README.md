# GitHub organization: Numeral-Liberation-Front

## Description

The Numeric Liberation Front is a movement to make all numbers legal, and not evil.

## More info

[https://github.com/Numeral-Liberation-Front](https://github.com/Numeral-Liberation-Front/)

This organization is used for the archival and development of the Numeral Liberation Front project, a project aimed at making social and legal changes with 2 major goals:

1. Revert numbers such as 88 and 1488 back into normal, non-Nazi, non-hateful numbers.

2. Make it illegal to make it illegal to copyright a number or hex code.

## Extra info

This is a community project, and is a group project. As a society, we need to make numbers completely neutral, legal, and free to use by anyone, anywhere, under any circumstances.
