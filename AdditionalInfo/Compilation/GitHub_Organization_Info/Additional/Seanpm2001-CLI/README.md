# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-CLI

## Description

My GitHub organization for my projects with a Command Line Interface (CLI) or a text only interface.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-CLI](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-CLI)

This organization is used for the archival and development of my projects that work solely in a command line interface (CLI) or heavily require the use of a command line. These programs don't have graphics, they are only text. The closest graphics can get here is ASCII art, or colored text. The opposite of this organization is [Seanpm2001-GUI](/AdditionalInfo/1/Seanpm2001-GUI/) which is for projects that have a GUI (Graphical User Interface) if you are uncomfortable with the command line, you should try to learn to become comfortable with it. If you can't, the GUI is a better fit, as it has images, video, audio, and text.
