This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in Markdown. The original rule was that Markdown had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any Markdown code is included. For quality control reasons, only projects that heavily utilize Markdown are included. More info is available below.

### Extra notes

I couldn't find a good glossy image of markdown, so I went with the most detailed logo I could find, which was a pretty small image. I hope to replace it in the future.

Markdown had to be limited, as currently, over 99.2% of my projects contain markdown.
