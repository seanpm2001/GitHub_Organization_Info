# GitHub organization: 360Desktop-development

## Description

The GitHub organization for the archival and development of the 360Desktop project.

## More info

[https://github.com/360Desktop-development](https://github.com/360Desktop-development/)

This project hosts the archival and development of the 360 desktop project, a desktop extension that allows 360Â° technologies on the Linux desktop.

## Extra info

This is NOT a category project.

This is a normal project.

This is the second organization for the 360Desktop project. The main homepage lies [here](/AdditionalInfo/2/360Desktop/).

Support for Windows, MacOS, BSD, and other operating systems is coming soon.

This project is very early in development, and is not functional yet. It needs more backers and developers.

The logo for this project is in PNG format. It is not transparent, and has a black background. It is doable for now.

Due to issues with GitHub, this organization is currently empty, as I can't fork projects here at the moment.

The homepage for this project is located [`here`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/360Desktop-development/).
