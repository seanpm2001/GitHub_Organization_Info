# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-Python

## Description

My GitHub organization for my projects written in Pascal.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Pascal-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Pascal-lang)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in Pascal. The original rule was that Pascal had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any Pascal code is included.
