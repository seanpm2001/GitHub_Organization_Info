# GitHub organization: PVZ-Custom

## Description

For the development of my Plants vs. Zombies fangame project.

This organization is used for the development of my Plants vs. Zombies fangame project, which is in extremely early development and can't be finished due to issues with resources, and the fact that EA has taken down fan-games in the past. It would probably be a lot easier if PopCap still existed separately from EA.

The Primal Sunflower from Plants vs. Zombies 2 was used as the stock image for this organization, as it is my favorite plant from the 2nd game, outshadowing the first game (my favorite from the original game couldn't be determined, as it was hard to pick a favorite, so I went with the second game)
