## More info

[https://github.com/WacOS-Dev](https://github.com/WacOS-Dev)

This organization is used for the development of the WacOS Linux distribution, which is a Linux distribution targeted at Apple UI enthusiasts, and provides an enhanced version of support for the GUI and CLI of MacOS and other Apple systems from the 1970s onward. To distance this from being a desktop environment rather than a full-fledged distribution, support for all Apple technologies is also included, such as APFS, HFS, HFS+, etc. support and support for natively running DMG and IPA files.
