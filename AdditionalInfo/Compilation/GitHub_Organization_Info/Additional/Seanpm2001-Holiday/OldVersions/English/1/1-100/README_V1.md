# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-Holiday

## Description

For the archival and development of my Holiday projects.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Holiday](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Holiday)

This organization is used for the archival and development of my Holiday projects, projects used for Holiday purposes.

## Extra info

Not to be confused with [Seanpm2001-Holidays](/AdditionalInfo/2/Seanpm2001-Holidays/) which is the same thing, but with a slightly longer name.

I used a silver version of the letter/number Pi to represent Pi day as a holiday, as it the best one that would stand out and not be controversial, and also because I didn't want to use another generic stock photo.
