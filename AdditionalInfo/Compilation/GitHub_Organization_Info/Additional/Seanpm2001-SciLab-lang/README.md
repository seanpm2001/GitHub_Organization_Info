## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-SciLab-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-SciLab-lang/)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in SciLab. The original rule was that SciLab had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any SciLab code is included.
