For the archival and development of my projects written in the UnrealScript programming language, or containing UnrealScript source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-UnrealScript-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-UnrealScript-lang/)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in UnrealScript. The original rule was that UnrealScript had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any UnrealScript code is included.
