This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in the XS programming language. The original rule was that XS had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any XS source code is included.

## Extra info

XS is the name of the language

XS is a recognized language by GitHub.

I don't know what XS stands for, in the sense of programming languages.

Based on noted usage patterns, XS is most commonly used with Perl.

The current logo in use is in PNG format. This means that it is transparent, and it does not need background color fixes. I am using the a generic logo, as XS doesn't appear to have its own logo.

XS programs have the `.xs` file extension.

The official GitHub organization for XS is located at [Unknown](https://github.com/)
