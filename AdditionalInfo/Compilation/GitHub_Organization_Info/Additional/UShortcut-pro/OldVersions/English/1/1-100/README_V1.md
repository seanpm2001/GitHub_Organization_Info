## More info

[https://github.com/UShortcut-pro](https://github.com/UShortcut-pro)

This organization is used for the development of my Shortcut creation and management tool, UShortcut professional. It is still very early in development.

### Extra notes

The current stock image for this organization is a folder with a redirect. I labeled it as a `dirty folder` as the image is slightly grainy, but wasn't bad enough to make me find another stock image.
