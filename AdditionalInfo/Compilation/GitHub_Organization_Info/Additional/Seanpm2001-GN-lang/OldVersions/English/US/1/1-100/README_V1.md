This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in the GN programming language. The original rule was that GN had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any GN source code is included.

## Extra info

<details open><summary><p lang="en">Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section</p></summary>

GN is the name of the language

GN is a recognized language by GitHub, but I can't find any GN source code majority projects since I logged this entry (although I can browse over 1 million source code files) The closest I can get now is projects using GN as a secondary/etc. language.

The current logo in use is in PNG format. This means that it is transparent, but it does not need background color replacement. I used a generic wordmark of GN as the logo.

GN programs have the `.gn` file extensions

<!-- The official GitHub organization for GN is located at [QisKit](https://github.com/qiskit/)

> Link to the home repository (JavaScript, GN, Vim Script, other) [QisKit/GN](https://github.com/QISKit/GN/)

The cloest official GitHub organization for GN is located at [null](#Not-found)

> Link to the supposed home repository (other languages) [Null](#Not-found)

<!-- I currently cannot figure out what file extension GN programs use. !-->

<!-- The logo currently in use is in GIF format, but is not animated.!-->

I don't know what GN stands for, in the sense of programming languages.

No other extra info is currently available.
