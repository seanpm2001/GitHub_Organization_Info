# GitHub organization: MEDOS-SSD

## Description

The GitHub organization for MEDOS SSD, the Solid State Drive variant of the MEDOS operating system. Part of the Meadows operating system project.

## More info

[https://github.com/MEDOS-SSD](https://github.com/MEDOS-SSD/)

This project hosts the archival and development of the MEDOS subproject, MEDOS SSD, a variant of MEDOS meant to be run directly off a Solid State Drive (SSD)

## Extra info

This is not a category project.

The logo for this project is a solid state drive with the dark green `MEDOS` wordmark above it, and the text:

- Operating System

Below the SSD. The SSD icon has the text `SSD` clearly labeled on it already, so I decided not to make separate subtext for it. Context is destroyed if you take out the icon.

This is the second highest/highest tier storage device that MEDOS can operate on. The next level up is [`MEDOS Tape Drive`](/AdditionalInfo/2/MEDOS-TapeDrive/)

Due to my inability to fork GitHub repositories outside of my own account at the moment, this organization is currently empty.

The homepage for this project is located [`here (seanpm2001/MEDOS-SSD`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/MEDOS-SSD/)
