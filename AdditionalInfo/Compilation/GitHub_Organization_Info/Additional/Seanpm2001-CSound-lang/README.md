# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-CSound-lang

## Description

For the development of my projects written in the CSound/CSound document language, or containing CSound/CSound document source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-CSound-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-CSound-lang)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in CSound. The original rule was that CSound had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any CSound code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

### Extra notes

This language has 2 variants: CSound and CSound document.

This language doesn't have an icon, so I used the PNG version of an SVG image of a musical note as the organization pic
