# GitHub organization: QMeadows-development

## Description

The development organization for Meadows, a future dream Quantum computer operating system.

This organization is used for the development of the open source Meadows Quantum computer operating system, my dream operating system that went into planning in 2013. It is expected to be a Quantum Computer operating system, with enough customization to have at least 10 settings for every pixel on a 64K screen. It is heavily inspired by Compiz, Windows XP, OS X 10.8, and many of own ideas. It has been planned for years, but not much development has come to it yet.

I originally was going to make development completely private, but I decided I needed help. The project is very far from completion, currently being less than 0.00001% complete.
