# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-Brainfuck-lang

## Description

For the archival and development of my projects written in the Brainfuck programming language, or containing Brainfuck source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Brainfuck-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Brainfuck-lang/)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in Brainfuck. The original rule was that Brainfuck had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any Brainfuck code is included.

## Extra info

This project uses a low quality cracked skull image. I couldn't find any image that was appropriate related to the subject, as the language has no official icon.

This is my first project to use the F word uncensored in its name. GitHub actually spells out the language uncensored as `brainfuck` via GitHub linguist, so they are OK with it.

There are no problems with using swear words on GitHub unless you use it in a hateful or harmful way. I also try to limit my usage, as overusage of a swear word weakens its meaning. It also looks very childish if you use the F word in every sentence.

Despite this project having the F word in the name, you have to use the whole word to search for it in my profile. Simply typing `fuck` will not bring any results, you have to write `brainfuck`

My usage of the F word online has gone up by over 25000% in the past 48 hours due to this project.
