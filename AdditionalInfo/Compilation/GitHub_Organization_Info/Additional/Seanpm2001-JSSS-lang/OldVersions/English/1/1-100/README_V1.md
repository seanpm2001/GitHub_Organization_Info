# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-JSSS-lang

## Description

For the development of my projects written in the JSSS (JavaScript Style Sheets) language, or containing JSSS source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-JSSS-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-JSSS-lang)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in JSSS. The original rule was that JSSS had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any JSSS code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

### Extra notes

This language is not to be confused with JavaScript or CSS (Cascade Styling Sheets) this language was an obscure mixture of the 2 that never caught on.

I used the logo for NetScape Navigator, as they are the ones that developed this language (they also originally invented JavaScript, along with many other web technologies we still use today, for example, Firefox is based on Netscape, most schemas and web browser features originated from Netscape, many HTML and CSS features came from Netscape, and more) I also couldn't find a picture for JSSS, the closest I could get was JSS, and it wasn't as good, so I chose Netscapes logo.
