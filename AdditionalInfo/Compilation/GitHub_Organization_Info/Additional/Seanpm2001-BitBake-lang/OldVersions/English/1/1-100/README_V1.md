# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-BitBake-lang

## Description

For the archival and development of my projects written in the BitBake programming language, or containing BitBake source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-BitBake-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-BitBake-lang/)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in BitBake. The original rule was that BitBake had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any BitBake code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

## Extra info

This project uses the logo of the company that made BitBake, as it seems BitBake doesn't have its own logo.
