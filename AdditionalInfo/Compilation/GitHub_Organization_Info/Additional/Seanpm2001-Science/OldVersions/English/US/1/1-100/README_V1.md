# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-Science

## Description

My GitHub organization for my scientific projects and forks. This is NOT for computer science in general.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Science](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Science/)

This project hosts archives and development regarding scientific projects and development by me and other users.

## Extra info

Computer science in general isn't counted here, as that would count as nearly every project. The type of science archived here is science regarding the scientific method, and other scientific discoveries, including those related to computers, but not generally about software.

A glossy version of the Aperture Science logo from the Portal video game franchise is used here, as it is the most recognizable, and just looks really good.
