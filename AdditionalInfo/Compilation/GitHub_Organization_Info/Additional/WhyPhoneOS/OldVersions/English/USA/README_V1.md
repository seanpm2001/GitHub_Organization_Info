# GitHub organization: WhyPhoneOS

## Description

The GitHub organization for whyPhoneOS, an open source remake of iPhoneOS 1-3 (for iOS 4 and up, see @WacOS-wOS) Part of the WacOS operating system project.

## More info

[https://github.com/WhyPhoneOS](https://github.com/WhyPhoneOS/)

This project hosts the archival and development of my project, WhyPhoneOS, which is a subsystem of the WacOS project that aims to imitate/recreate the iPhoneOS series of Apple operating systems. It is currently very early in development, and is not functional yet.

## Extra info

This is not a category project.

The logo for this project is a custom logo, consisting of the `whyPhoneOS` logomark across a thin-lined background

This project covers iPhoneOS 1 to 3 and NOT iOS 4 and up. For iOS 4 and up, see the separate project [`@WacOS-wOS`](/AdditionalInfo/2/WacOS-wOS)

Due to my inability to fork GitHub repositories outside of my own account at the moment, this organization is currently empty.

The homepage for this project is located [`here (seanpm2001/WhyPhoneOS`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WhyPhoneOS/)
