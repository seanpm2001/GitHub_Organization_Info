# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-GUI

## Description

For my projects that contain a Graphical User Interface (GUI)

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-GUI](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-GUI)

This organization is used for the archival and development of my projects that work solely in a graphical user interface (GUI) or heavily require the use of a graphical user interrface. These programs contain have graphics, they don't have only text. The opposite of this organization is [Seanpm2001-CLI](/AdditionalInfo/1/Seanpm2001-CLI/) which is for projects that have a CLI (Command Line Interface) if you are uncomfortable with the command line, you should try to learn to become comfortable with it. If you can't, the GUI is a better fit, as it has images, video, audio, and text.
