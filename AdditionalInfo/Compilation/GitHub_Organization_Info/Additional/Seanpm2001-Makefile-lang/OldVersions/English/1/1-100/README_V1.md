# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-Makefile-lang

## Description

For the development of my projects written in the Makefile language, or containing Makefile source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Makefile-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Makefile-lang)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in Makefile. The original rule was that Makefile had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any Makefile code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

### Extra notes

Makefile doesn't have an official logo, so I used the closest thing I could find, which is also something I have used in the past. It is an unofficial logo.
