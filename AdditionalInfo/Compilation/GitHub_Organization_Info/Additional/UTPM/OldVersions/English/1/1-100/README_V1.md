## Description

UTPM (UnTrusted Platform Module) is an open-source, reverse-engineered TPM chip emulator, focusing on providing TPM support on devices without being malicious. It is also a movement against TPM.

## More info

[https://github.com/UTPM](https://github.com/UTPM/)

This project is a counter movement towards TPM ("Trusted" Platform Module) a malicious cryptoprocessor in use on laptops that come pre-loaded with Windows. It has been getting promoted more and more over the years, and with Windows 11, it almost became mandatory. It is essentially a piece of DRM, and has no place in a persnal computer.

## Extra info

"Trusted" is in parentheses, as this is just a marketing word. Microsoft may trust it, but for a user, it is untrustable. Since this is a piece of DRM (in hardware format) essentially, you are giving all your trust to this processor, and in the process, giving up your power over your computer, giving your computer power over you.

I use Untrusted/Untrustable as the name, despite it possibly making it sound like this project is "untrustable" it is the closest I could get to TPM, and I wanted to attack the term.
