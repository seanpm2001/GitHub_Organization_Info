# GitHub organization: JScribe-dev

## Description

The GitHub organization for JScribe, an open source journal assistant tool for self-scribing.

## More info

[https://github.com/JScribe-dev](https://github.com/JScribe-dev/)

This project is for archives and developments of the project JScribe, which is a tool to to help the process of writing a journal/life archive project, including tasks such as self-scribing.

## Extra info

This project uses a generic feather logo with no gradient or pattern. It will be replaced with a Skeuomorphic version in the future.

The name [`JScribe`](https://github.com/Jscribe/) was already taken, but was in use by an empty organization, with no profile picture, no description, no bio, and no repositories.

Since I can't fork projects at the moment, this organization is currently empty.

The home repository for this project, lies at [seanpm2001/JScribe](https://github.com/seanpm2001/JScribe/)
