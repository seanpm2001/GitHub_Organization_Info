# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-Statistics

## Description

The alternative Seanpm2001 GitHub organization for statistical related projects and forks.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Statistics](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Statistics/)

This project hosts the development and archival of projects and forks related to statistics. It is a duplicate of [`seanpm2001-stats`](/AdditionalInfo/2/Seanpm2001-Stats/)

## Extra info

This is a category project.

I am using a glossy pie chart icon for this project, as I already used a different statistic icon earlier.

This project is for projects about statistics.

Example projects include:

- [`GitHub Stats A`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/GitHub_Stats_A/)
- [`GitHub Statistics`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/GitHub_Statistics/)
- [`Meadows_Mod_Profile_User_Stats`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Meadows_Mod_Profile_User_Stats/)
- [`seanwallawalla-stats`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/seanwallawalla-stats/)

<!--
As of 2022, May 27th, I don't have any projects that use for this organization yet.
!-->

Due to my inability to fork GitHub repositories outside of my own account at the moment, this organization is currently empty.

The homepage for this project is located [`here (unavailable, there is no current home repository for this project)`](https://www.example.com/)
