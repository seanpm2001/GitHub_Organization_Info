For the archival and development of my pharmacy related projects. This is not to be confused with my [@seanwallawalla-health](/AdditionalInfo/1/Seanwallawalla-health/) or [@seanpm2001-Health](/AdditionalInfo/1/Seanpm2001-Health) this is a subcategory.

## Extra info

I used a modified stock image of the caduceus, which is not to be confused with the Rod of Asclepius, which is an Ancient medical symbol that would have been better suited here.
