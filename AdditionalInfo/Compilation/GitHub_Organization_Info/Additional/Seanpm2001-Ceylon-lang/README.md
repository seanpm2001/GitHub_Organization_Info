# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-Ceylon-lang

## Description

For the archival and development of my projects written in the Ceylon programming language, or containing Ceylon source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Ceylon-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Ceylon-lang/)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in the Ceylon programming language. The original rule was that Ceylon had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any Ceylon source code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

## Extra info

Ceylon is the name of the language.

Ceylon is a recognized language by GitHub.

I think I am using the Ceylon logo, but I am not sure.

<!-- The current logo in use is in JPEG format. This means that it is not transparent, but it needs a replacement without a solid white background. !-->

Ceylon programs use the `.ceylon` file extension.

<!-- The logo currently in use is in GIF format, but is not animated.!-->

<!--I don't know what Ceylon-lang stands for, in the sense of programming languages. !-->

No other extra info available.
