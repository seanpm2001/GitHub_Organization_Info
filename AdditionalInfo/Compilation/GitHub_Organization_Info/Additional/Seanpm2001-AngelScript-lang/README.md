# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-AngelScript-lang

## Description

For the archival and development of my projects written in the AngelScript programming language, or containing AngelScript source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-AngelScript-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-AngelScript-lang/)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in AngelScript. The original rule was that AngelScript had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any AngelScript code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

## Extra info

AngelScript is commonly confused with ActionScript, I learnt of its existance by mistake this way.
