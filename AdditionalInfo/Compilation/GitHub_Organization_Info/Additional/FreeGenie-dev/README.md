# GitHub organization: FreeGenie-dev

## Description

For the archival and development of the FreeGenie project, a database and rescue operation for children being abused/isolated from the world.

## More info

[https://github.com/FreeGenie-dev](https://github.com/FreeGenie-dev/)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my project FreeGenie-dev, an awareness tool and database for rescuing people who have been locked up against their will, and helping them recover.

## Extra info

This project is written in Genie. Not all platforms support this language, so its use is a little limited. Software diversity must be supported though, so this stays.

FreeGenie doesn't stand for free software Genie, as all my projects are Free Libre and Open Source, it stands for Let's Free Genie

There isn't currently a way to know how many people are being locked up against their will in their own house/elsewhere. The number goes up for a while when they are found, then goes back down.

This project is dedicated to Genie (real name (disputed): Susan Wiley) a feral child who was locked up from age ~1.6 to ~13.55 and suffered severe trauma and developmental problems from her abuse.

I am still looking for ways to improve the rescue success rate of this project.

A picture of Genie working with a social worker is used as the project icon, it is the only square photo of Genie I could find.
