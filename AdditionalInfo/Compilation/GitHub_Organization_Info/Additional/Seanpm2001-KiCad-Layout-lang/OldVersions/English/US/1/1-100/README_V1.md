This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in the KiCad-Layout programming language. The original rule was that KiCad-Layout had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any KiCad-Layout source code is included.

## Extra info

KiCad Layout is the name of the language

KiCad Layout is a recognized language by GitHub.

The current logo in use is in JPEG format. This means that it is not transparent, but it does need a background color replacement. I used the official logo for KiCad, just an older version.

KiCad Layout programs don't have a file extension, but go under names like `fp-lib-table` or other names with a defined syntax. `.kicad_pcb` seems to work as well. However, KiCad Schematic files have the `.sch` file extensions

<!-- I currently cannot figure out what file extension KiCad-Layout programs use. !-->

<!-- The logo currently in use is in GIF format, but is not animated.!-->

I don't know what KiCad Layout stands for, in the sense of programming languages.

No other extra info is currently available.
