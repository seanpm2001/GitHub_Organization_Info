# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-HaProxy-lang

## Description

For the archival and development of my projects written in the HaProxy programming language, or containing HaProxy source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-HaProxy-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-HaProxy-lang/)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in HaProxy. The original rule was that HaProxy had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any HaProxy code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

## Extra info

HaProxy is a sub-language to GitHub (similar to Markdown, YAML, XML, etc.) It won't show up in your project unless you enable it via your `.gitattributes` file, as of 2021 Saturday November 27th.
