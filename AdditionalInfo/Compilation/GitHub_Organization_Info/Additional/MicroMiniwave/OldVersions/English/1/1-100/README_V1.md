## More info

[https://github.com/MicroMiniwave](https://github.com/MicroMiniwave)

This organization is used for the development of my open source Microwave operating system, μMiniwave (Pronounced: Micro Miniwave or Mu Miniwave) since there aren't any known open source microwaves, and the world should do whatever it can to rid itself of proprietary software.
