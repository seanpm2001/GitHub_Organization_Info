# GitHub organization: AZWS-Encryption

## Description

AZWS Encryption is a Hobbyist broken plain text encryption specification for lazy writers. Not for professional use.

## More info

[https://github.com/AZWS-Encryption](https://github.com/AZWS-Encryption/)

This project hosts archives and developments of the project AZWS Encryption, a programming education project for an introduction to algorithms. It is based off a style of lazy typing, but was repurposed to also be used in computer science education, as it is really good for learning algorithms.

## Extra info

Not to be confused with AWS. The Z isn't to try to take the term Amazon Web Services, but is used to describe the typing layout of the algorithm, similar to QWERTY.

The way this system works is that each letter/digit has 4-8 different possibilities, an A can be either A, Z, W, S, or Q on a QWERTY keyboard, and you have to find which letter is correct by trying different combinations. For example, take this:

Aoope

This can mean many things, but here, it translates to Apple (A -> A, O -> P, O -> P, P -> L, E -> E)

I am using a generic encryption icon as the logo for now, as it fits somewhat, although this is not a type of encryption you should use outside of education purposes.
