# GitHub organization: SourceBase-dev

## Description

For the development of the SourceBase web template.

## More info

[https://github.com/SourceBase-dev](https://github.com/SourceBase-dev)

This organization is used for the development of my SourceBase web template, my advanced HTML, CSS, JS, Ruby, and PHP boilerplates that I use to develop SNU. I expanded it, so that it can be used on other projects, with little to no SNU branding.

### Extra notes

I chose a castle as the stock image for this organization, as it was the best thing I could find that was related to a base. A castle is technically a medieval miltary base, and it has cool graphics, so I chose it as the template image.
