# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-G-Code-lang

## Description

For the archival and development of my projects written in the G-Code programming language, or containing G-Code source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-G-Code-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-G-Code-lang/)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in the G-Code programming language. The original rule was that G-Code had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any G-Code source code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

## Extra info

G-Code is the name of the language.

G-Code is a recognized language by GitHub.

I am using a custom G-Code logo. G-code does not have an official logo.

<!-- The current logo in use is in JPEG format. This means that it is not transparent, but it needs a replacement without a solid white background. !-->

G-Code files use the `.gcode` file extension.

<!-- The logo currently in use is in GIF format, but is not animated.!-->

<!--I don't know what G-Code-lang stands for, in the sense of programming languages. !-->

No other extra info available.
