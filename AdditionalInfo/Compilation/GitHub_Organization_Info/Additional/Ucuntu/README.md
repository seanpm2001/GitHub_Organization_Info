## More info

[https://github.com/Ucuntu](https://github.com/Ucuntu)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my Ucuntu malware program, inspired by the YouTuber [Danooct1](https://www.youtube.com/user/danooct1)'s viewer made malware series.

This program comes with no warranty, please only run this in a virtual machine. I am not responsible for any damage caused by this program,

This program is a piece of malware, but malware can be creative too. It does not contain any ransomware, as that is the type of malware I hate the most and will never develop.

Yes the name is vulgar, but it was something I came up with.
