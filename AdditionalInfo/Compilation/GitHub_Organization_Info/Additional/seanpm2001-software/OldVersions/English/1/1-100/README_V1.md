## More info

[https://github.com/seanpm2001-software](https://github.com/seanpm2001-software)

This organization is used for my software that is in a modern format. It is not to be confused with [seanwallawalla-software](https://github.com/seanwallawalla-software) which has the same main projects, but uses outdated branding, and is mostly the same.

This project uses the old SWW (SeanWallaWalla) branding (2015-2019) the preferred format is now SPM2001 (Seanpm2001)
