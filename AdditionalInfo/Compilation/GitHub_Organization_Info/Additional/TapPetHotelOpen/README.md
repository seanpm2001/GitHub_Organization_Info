# GitHub organization: TapPetHotelOpen

## Description

The GitHub organization for Tap Pet Hotel Open, an open source recreation of the Pocket Gems game Tap Pet Hotel.

## More info

[https://github.com/TapPetHotelOpen](https://github.com/TapPetHotelOpen/)

This project hosts archives and developments of the Tap Pet Hotel Open project, an open source recreation of the Pocket Gems game Tap Pet Hotel.

## Extra info

This project is still very early in development.

Upon creating this organization, I had to search this project up. I have attempted it in the past, but didn't get very far. The old project is likely to be merged with the new project.

This project is currently written in Ruby.

This project currently uses the logo for Tap Pet Hotel (original) and contains the PocketGems logo. It will likely be changed in the future.

The home repository for this project (the original draft) lies at [seanpm2001/Tap_Pet_Hotel_Open](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Tap_Pet_Hotel_Open/)

The new home repository for this project (the improved version) lies at [seanpm2001/TapPetHotelOpen](https://github.com/seanpm2001/TapPetHotelOpen/)
