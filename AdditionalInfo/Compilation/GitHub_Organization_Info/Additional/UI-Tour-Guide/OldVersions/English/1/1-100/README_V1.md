## More info

This organization is used for the development of my UI Tour guide software, which give users a tour of your UI so you don't have to explain as much. 

Note: yes I know the logo was faking transparency, the grid pattern is part of the image, and it is not a transparent PNG file. It was the best I could get for now.
