# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-GetText-lang

## Description

For the archival and development of my projects written in the GetText programming language, or containing GetText source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-GetText-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-GetText-lang/)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in the GetText language. The original rule was that GetText had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any GetText source code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

## Extra info

This language is used for GetText catalogs/translation files. I am not sure of any other usage.
