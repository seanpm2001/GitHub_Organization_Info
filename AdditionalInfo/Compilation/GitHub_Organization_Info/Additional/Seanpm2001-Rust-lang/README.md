# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-Rust-lang

## Description

My GitHub organization for my Rust-based projects.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Rust-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Rust-lang)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in Rust. The original rule was that Rust had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any Rust code is included.
