This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in the Open Policy Agent programming language. The original rule was that Open Policy Agent had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any Open Policy Agent source code is included.

Open Policy Agent is the name of the language

Open Policy Agent is a recognized language by GitHub.

Open Policy Agent can be shortened to `opa`

Open Policy Agent is a policy engine language.

The current logo in use is in PNG format. This means that it is transparent, and it does not need background color fixes. I am using the official OpenPolicyAgent logo, which has transparency.

OpenPolicyAgent programs have the `.OpenPolicyAgent` file extension.

The official GitHub organization for Open Policy Agent is located at [Open-Policy-Agent](https://github.com/Open-Policy-Agent/)
