# GitHub organization: VOI-Manor

## Description

VOI Manor is a backup tool and emulator for VoIP services such as Discord.

## More info

[https://github.com/VOI-Manor](https://github.com/VOI-Manor)

This organization is used for the archival and development of the VoI Manor VoIP packaging and viewing tool, a tool to export and view Discord servers, along with other VoIP software servers.

## Extra notes

I started a project on 2021 August 27th known as VOI Manor, which is a tool that can backup Discord servers and other VoIP servers into a hard copy file format, so that you can alternate from Discord and other services, and also set up Discord servers more efficiently. It is still very early in development, but it has been an idea since day 2 of me using Discord (not day 1, as I didn't fully get into Discord on the first day) the projects theme color is purple, and the name VOI is a shorthand for Voice Over IP address, which is the type of service it backs up. The manor part is so it has a unique name, and is a home/manor to VoIP backup data. I purposefully left off the P from the name, as VOIP Manor doesn't sound as good. I also considered calling it VOID Manor, but that didn't fit either. The project is written in Python, but contains custom languages used for backup files, such as `.disdat` which is a mixture of JSON, Java, JavaScript, Python, and Shell.
