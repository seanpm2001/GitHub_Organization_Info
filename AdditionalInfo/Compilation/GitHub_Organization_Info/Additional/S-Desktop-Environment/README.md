This organization is used for the archival and development of my desktop environment known as SDE, Skeuowie, or S Desktop Environment. It is a UNIX desktop environment with a sole focus on full skeuomorphism, but also focuses heavily on performance and security. This environment will never go towards flat design, material design, or the likes, just skeuomorphism.
