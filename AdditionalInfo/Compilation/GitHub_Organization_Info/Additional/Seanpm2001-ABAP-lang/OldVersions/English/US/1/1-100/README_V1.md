This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in the ABAP programming language. The original rule was that ABAP had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any ABAP source code is included.

## Extra info

<details open><summary><p lang="en">Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section</p></summary>

ABAP is the name of the language

ABAP is a recognized language by GitHub.

ABAP is a language by Microsoft.

The current logo in use is in PNG format. This means that it is not transparent, but it does not need background color replacement. I am using a generic logo, as ABAP doesn't appear to have its own logo.

ABAP programs have the `.abap` file extension.

The official GitHub organization for ABAP is located at [Microsoft](https://github.com/microsoft/)

<!-- I currently cannot figure out what file extension ABAP programs use. !-->

<!-- The logo currently in use is in GIF format, but is not animated.!-->

<!--I don't know what ABAP-lang stands for, in the sense of programming languages. !-->

No other extra info is currently available.
