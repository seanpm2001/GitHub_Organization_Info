# GitHub organization: CottonTree

## Description

My GitHub organization for the CottonTree software library, a library for efficient cloth modeling.

## More info

[https://github.com/CottonTree](https://github.com/CottonTree)

This organization is used for the archival and development of my inhouse software library project known as CottonTree, which is an advanced and efficient Cloth Modeling software library.

## Extra info

Yes, I know cotton grows on shrubs, not trees. I just found CottonTree to be a better sounding name than CottonShrub or CottonBush.
