# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-Academic-Free-License

## Description

My GitHub organization for my projects licensed under one of the Academic Free License (AFL) software licenses.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Academic-Free-License](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Academic-Free-License/)

My GitHub organization for my projects licensed under one of the Academic Free License (AFL) software licenses.

## Extra info

This is a category project.

Since the Academic Free License doesn't have its own logo, I quickly created a logo graphic in GIMP for this project. The project file is located [here](/AdditionalInfo/2/Seanpm2001-Academic-Free-License/AFL_License_Project_512x512.xcf) and the uncompressed version is located [here](/AdditionalInfo/2/Seanpm2001-Academic-Free-License/AFL_License_NoCompression_512x512.png)

This project is only for Academic Free License licensed projects under the following licenses:

| License (SPDX) | License name |
|----|----|
| [`AFL-1.1`](https://spdx.org/licenses/AFL-1.1.html) | `Academic Free License v1.1` |
| [`AFL-1.2`](https://spdx.org/licenses/AFL-1.2.html) | `Academic Free License v1.2` |
| [`AFL-2.0`](https://spdx.org/licenses/AFL-2.0.html) | `Academic Free License v2.0` |
| [`AFL-2.1`](https://spdx.org/licenses/AFL-2.1.html) | `Academic Free License v2.1` |
| [`AFL-3.0`](https://spdx.org/licenses/AFL-3.0.html) | `Academic Free License v3.0` |

The only exception is the usual global repositories (such as the current repository `GitHub_Organization_Info` which is licensed under the GNU General Public License V3.0) and projects that give licensing info.
