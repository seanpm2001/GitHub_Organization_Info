This project hosts the archival and development of my joke program known as KeyStroke, which is a random text input program, and a keylogger blocker.

## Extra info

<em>Jokes aside, a stroke is a serious problem. If you feel you are having a stroke, or see someone showing symptoms, call your local emergency number immediately. It is a matter of life and death.</em>

**Note:** someone typing in the way that is joked about here isn't usually a stroke, please don't waste the time of emergency services unless you are completely sure someone is suffering from a stroke/its symptoms.

`qwerglrflop` is just an example of a keyboard stroke. This random jumbled group of characters popped into my head before developing, and I had the perfect opportunity to use it.

In Internet humor, a keyboard stroke is when you are typing normally, then you start typing like the above example. This program makes the joke of generating random text after a set amount of typing is done.

This program is a joke program, but it contains an additional feature which blocks keyloggers.

This project is still very early in development.

The icon used for this project is a medical example of a mini stroke, a less severe but still deadly type of stroke.
