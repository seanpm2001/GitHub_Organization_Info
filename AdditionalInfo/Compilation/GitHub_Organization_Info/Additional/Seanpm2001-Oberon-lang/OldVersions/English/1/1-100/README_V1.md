# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-Oberon-lang

## Description

For the development of my projects written in the Oberon language, or containing Oberon source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Oberon-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Oberon-lang)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in Oberon. The original rule was that Oberon had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any Oberon code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

### Extra notes

I couldn't find a square icon for this language, so the image was mostly cut off in the organization phone.
