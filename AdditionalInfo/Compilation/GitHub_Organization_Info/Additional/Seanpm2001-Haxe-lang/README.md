# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-Haxe-lang

## Description

For the archival and development of my projects written in the Haxe programming language, or containing Haxe source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Haxe-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Haxe-lang/)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in Haxe. The original rule was that Haxe had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any Haxe code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

## Extra info

I discovered this language via Gedit.
