# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-SourceForge

## Description

The Seanpm2001 GitHub organization for SourceForge related projects, but NOT for SourceForge mirrors.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-SourceForge](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-SourceForge/)

This project hosts archives and developments of my projects related to the SourceForge website. It is not to be used just for projects of mine that were mirrored to SourceForge.

## Extra info

This is a category project.

I am using a semi-high quality (900x900) image of the SourceForge logo with a Gr√¶y background. In the future, it should br replaced with a transparent version.

SourceForge is similar to GitHub, but is a different site, has a different owner, has different content on it, but it has some downsides (past history of hijacking projects that left SourceForge, past history of bundling malware into downloads, etc.) I am not sure if it is Git-based.

This organization is only for projects related to SourceForge development. Since I intend to possibly mirror my projects to SourceForge in the future, it is important to note that this organization is NOT solely for projects that were mirrored to SourceForge, but projects that heavily relate to/depend on SourceForge.
