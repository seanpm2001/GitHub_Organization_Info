## Description

The Seanpm2001 GitHub organization for technological standard projects.

## More info

This project hosts archives and developments of my projects related to software, hardware, and other technological standards.

## Extra info

This is a category project.

The logo of this project is a generic standards icon I found that was highly detailed.
