This organization is used for the development of the Tetris128 game, my very advanced implementation of Tetris designed to be the ultimate version of Tetris, and be open source. It contains unique features, like a softbody graphics mode, being able to play with 1 to 10 different types of Polyominoes, instead of just Tetrominoes, high levels of customization ability, and more.
