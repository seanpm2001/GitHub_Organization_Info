# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-Mako-lang

## Description

For the archival and development of my projects written in the Mako programming language, or containing Mako source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Mako-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Mako-lang/)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in the Mako programming language. The original rule was that Mako had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any Mako source code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

## Extra info

Mako is the name of the language.

I created a modified logo for this organization. See more [below](#Modified-logo).

<!--The logo currently in use is in GIF format, but is not animated. !-->

I don't know what Mako stands for, in the sense of programming languages.

### Modified logo

I am using a modified version of the [Mako logo](/AdditionalInfo/2/Seanpm2001-Mako-lang/makoLogo.png) as the version available didn't fit into a square frame. I used a [white border](/AdditionalInfo/2/Seanpm2001-Mako-lang/WhiteSquare600px.jpeg) and centered the image, enlarged it, then applied some pattern filling [all while using GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/). The project file is included [here](/AdditionalInfo/2/Seanpm2001-Mako-lang/MakoLogo_Modified_600px.xcf)

Due to the 1 megabyte size limit, I had to also create a compressed version. The uncompressed version can be viewed [here (1.5 MB)](/AdditionalInfo/2/Seanpm2001-Mako-lang/MakoLogo_Modified_600px.png)
