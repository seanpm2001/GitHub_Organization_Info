# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-Groovy-lang

## Description

For the archival and development of my projects written in the Groovy programming language, or containing Groovy source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Groovy-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Groovy-lang/)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in Groovy. The original rule was that Groovy had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any Groovy code is included.

## Extra info

None.
