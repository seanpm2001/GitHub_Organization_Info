# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-BSDL-lang

## Description

For the archival and development of my projects written in the BSDL programming language, or containing BSDL source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-BSDL-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-BSDL-lang/)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in BSDL. The original rule was that BSDL had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any BSDL code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

## Extra info

BSDL stands for **B**oundary **S**can **D**escription **L**anguage

This project currently uses a very low quality logo in GIF format.
