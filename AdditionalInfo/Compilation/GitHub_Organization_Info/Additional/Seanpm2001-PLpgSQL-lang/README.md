# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-PLpgSQL-lang

## Description

For the archival and development of my projects written in the PLpgSQL programming language, or containing PLpgSQL source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-PLpgSQL-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-PLpgSQL-lang/)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in the PLpgSQL programming language. The original rule was that PLpgSQL had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any PLpgSQL source code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

## Extra info

I made a mistake when naming the other oprganization. [PostGreSQL](/AdditionalInfo/2/Seanpm2001-PostGreSQL-lang) might have been recognized as a language on its own by GitHub in the past, but the closest I can find now is PLpgSQL.

The current logo in use is in png format. This means that it is transparent. This image does not have any issues with background color.

Both the PLpgSQL and PLpgSQL organizations use the PLpgSQL logo, however, this organization uses a higher quality (2400x2400) logo without a wordmark, while the other organization uses a lower quality (205x205) logo with a wordmark.

<!-- The current logo in use is in JPEG format. This means that it is not transparent, but it needs a replacement without a solid white background. !-->

PLpgSQL programs have the `.sql` file extension, which is the same for most SQL implementations and variations.

<!-- I currently cannot figure out what file extension PLpgSQL programs use. !-->

<!-- The logo currently in use is in GIF format, but is not animated.!-->

I don't know what PLpgSQL-lang stands for, in the sense of programming languages.

No other extra info available.
