# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-Jinja-lang

## Description

For the archival and development of my projects written in the Jinja programming language, or containing Jinja source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Jinja-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Jinja-lang/)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in Jinja. The original rule was that Jinja had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any Jinja code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

## Extra info

I discovered this language via GitHub.

<!-- Jinja doesn't have an official logo, so I used the best alternative I could find. It would be good if it didn't have the download icon. !-->
