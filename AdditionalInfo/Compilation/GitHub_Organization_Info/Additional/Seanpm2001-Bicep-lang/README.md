This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in the Bicep programming language. The original rule was that Bicep had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any Bicep source code is included.

## Extra info

<details open><summary><p lang="en">Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section</p></summary>

Bicep is the name of the language

Bicep is a recognized language by GitHub.

Bicep is a language by Microsoft.

The current logo in use is in PNG format. This means that it is transparent, but it does not need background color replacement. I am using a generic logo, as Bicep doesn't appear to have its own logo. I think the current logo is for Bicep.

The current logo is very low quality (100x100) and will need a replacement in the future.

Bicep programs have the `.bicep` file extension.

The official GitHub organization for Bicep is located at [Azure (Microsoft)](https://github.com/Azure/)

<!-- I currently cannot figure out what file extension Bicep programs use. !-->

<!-- The logo currently in use is in GIF format, but is not animated.!-->

<!--I don't know what Bicep-lang stands for, in the sense of programming languages. !-->

No other extra info is currently available.
