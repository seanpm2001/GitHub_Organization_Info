# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-YAML-lang

## Description

For the development of my projects written with YAML. For quality control, only projects that heavily utilize YAML are included.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-YAML-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-YAML-lang)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in YAML. The original rule was that YAML had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any YAML code is included. For quality control reasons, only projects that heavily utilize YAML are incldued. More info is below.

### Extra notes

YAML was limited due to the language being in heavy use on all sponsor-capable projects, as it is the default language for sponsors.
