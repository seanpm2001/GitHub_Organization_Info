# GitHub organization: StartFsck

## Description

For the archival and development of the StartFsck Windows virtual machine program.

## More info

[https://github.com/StartFsck](https://github.com/StartFsck/)

This organization is used for the archival and development of the StartFsck project, a piece of malware designed to only run in a virtual machine, that makes several modifications at the users choice to creatively mess up the Windows startup process via the Windows startup folder.

## Extra info

This project was originally just malware, but I came up with a new trick to make it less dangerous, which is to have it detect if it is in a virtual machine, and if it does, it will run inside. If not, it won't harm the computer. This is pro-VM code, not anti-VM code.

This project works on Windows versions Windows 95/Windows NT 4.0 and up. It does not run on Windows 3.11/Windows NT 3.51 or lower.

This project uses `Fsck` as a minced oath instead of the expletive `Fuck` to make it more appropriate.
