# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-NSFW

## Description

My GitHub organization for my projects that are Not Safe For Work (NSFW)

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-NSFW](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-NSFW)

This organization is for the development of my projects that are deemed Not Safe For Work (NSFW) as they cover topics such as sex and sexual humor. You need to be 18 years or older to use or develop these projects, although some projects (such as `SNU_2D_SexEducation` can be shown by a verified adult to students at the age to learn this)

These projects don't contain pornographic content by default, however these projects may be banned in certain countries with anti-sex laws (such as Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, Syria, etc.)
