# GitHub organization: URLL-Specification

## Description

This organization is for the archival and development of the documentation and source for the URLL file format specification.

## More info

[https://github.com/URLL-Specification](https://github.com/URLL-Specification/)

This organization is used for the archival and development of my URLL-Specification and software for the URLL file type, a shortcut file that expands on the URL file and adds support for lists of links, improved syntax, and a user interface. It currently only works on Linux.

## Extra info

The image I used needs an additional L at the end of it. My image manipulation skills are not good enough to do it myself.
