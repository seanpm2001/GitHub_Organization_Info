# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-MATLAB-lang

## Description

For the archival and development of my projects written in the MATLAB programming language, or containing MATLAB source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-MATLAB-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-MATLAB-lang/)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in MATLAB. The original rule was that MATLAB had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any MATLAB code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

## Extra info

The current logo in use for MATLAB is very low quality (200x200) and very grainy. It will need a replacement in the future.
