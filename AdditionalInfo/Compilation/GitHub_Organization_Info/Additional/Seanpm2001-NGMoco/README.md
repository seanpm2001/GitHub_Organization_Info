# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-NGMoco

## Description

For the development of my ngmoco:) related projects.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-NGMoco](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-NGMoco)

This organization is used for the archival and development of my projects related to the company NGMoco, currently only 1 project exists here, which is an attempt to recreate one of NGMocos games `Touch Pets Dogs 2` as it was a childhood game for me and many others, and can't be played anymore, because it was an online game. This game could have been an offline game, but I guess I have to be the one to attempt to recreate it in an offline way.

### Extra notes

I used the current logo of NGMoco, as it fits in a square picture format and a circular image format. The logo is incredibly generic, and can be easily confused with several different acronyms. This is a flaw of flat design, it also isn't eligable for ownership rights, but I will still credit the company for their logo, even though it isn't eligable for copyright.
