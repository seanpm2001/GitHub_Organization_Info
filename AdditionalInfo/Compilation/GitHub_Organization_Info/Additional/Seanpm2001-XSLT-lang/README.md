# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-XSLT-lang

## Description

For the development of my projects written in the XSL/XSLT language, or containing XSL/XSLT source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-XSLT-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-XSLT-lang)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in XSL/XSLT. The original rule was that XSL/XSLT had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any XSL/XSLT code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

### Extra notes

XLST stands for eXtensible Stylesheet Language Transformation. It can be shortened to XSL. It is a language that does what its acronym says, it is an XML stylesheet transformation language.
