# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-CLIPS-lang

## Description

For the archival and development of my projects written in the CLIPS programming language, or containing CLIPS source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-CLIPS-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-CLIPS-lang/)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in the CLIPS programming language. The original rule was that CLIPS had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any CLIPS source code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

## Extra info

CLIPS is the name of the language.

The logo currently in use is a simple wordmark, but does not include the `S` in the name. It is not the official CLIPS logo.

The logo currently in use is in GIF format, but is not animated.

CLIPS is a public domain software tool for building expert systems. The name is an acronym for "**C** **L**anguage **I**ntegrated **P**roduction **System**."
