## Description

My GitHub organization for my Marine Biology related projects.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-MarineBiology](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-MarineBiology)

This organization is used for the archive and development of my Marine Biology related projects, for researching, discussing, and viewing content and work related to aquatic life.

### Extra info

I used a stock photo of a Black Moore goldfish as this organizations logo, as it was the first type of fish I have ever had, and is my favorite type of goldfish. They are also commonly known as Telescope Goldfish.
