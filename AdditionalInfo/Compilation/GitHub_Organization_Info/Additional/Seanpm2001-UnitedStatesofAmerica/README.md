# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-UnitedStatesofAmerica

## Description

The Seanpm2001 GitHub organization for projects with United States of America themes/strong associations.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-UnitedStatesofAmerica](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-UnitedStatesofAmerica/)

This project hosts the archival and development of projects and forks that are strongly related to the United States of America (strong associations and or themes)

## Extra info (part 1)

This is a country category project.

The logo for this project is the GitHub United States Flag emoji `üá∫üá∏Ô∏è`. It is really low quality (64x64) and may need a higher quality replacement in the future.

I included this country in this list, as it is where I am from. I don't agree with most of the current events going on here, but it is my home country, and I hope it improves in the long term.

Due to my inability to fork GitHub repositories outside of my own account at the moment, this organization is currently empty.

The homepage for this project is located [`here (unavailable, there is no current home repository for this project)`](https://www.example.com/)
