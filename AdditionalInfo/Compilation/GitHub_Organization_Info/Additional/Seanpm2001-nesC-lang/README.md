# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-nesC-lang

## Description

For the archival and development of my projects written in the nesC programming language, or containing nesC source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-nesC-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-nesC-lang/)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in the nesC programming language. The original rule was that nesC had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any nesC source code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

## Extra info

nesC is the name of the language.

nesC is a recognized language by GitHub.

nesC is stylized as `nesC` with all lowercase letters, except for the `C`

nesC is a language native to the TinyOS operating system for embedded computers.

The current logo in use is in JPEG format. This means that it is not transparent, although it needs to be converted to PNG to get rid of the white background.

I am using the logo for TinyOS, as nesC doesn't have its own logo, and TinyOS is the closest I can get.

nesC programs have the `.nc` file extension.

<!-- I currently cannot figure out what file extension nesC programs use. !-->

<!-- The logo currently in use is in GIF format, but is not animated.!-->

<!--I don't know what nesC-lang stands for, in the sense of programming languages. !-->

No other extra info available.
