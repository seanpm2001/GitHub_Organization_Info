# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-Motorola-S-Record-lang

## Description

For the development of my projects written in the Motorola S-Record (SREC) language, or containing Motorola S-Record (SREC) source code.

## More info

https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Motorola-S-Record-lang

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in Motorolla S-Record (SREC). The original rule was that S-Record had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any S-Record code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

### Extra notes

This programming language doesn't have its own logo, so I used a modified version of the Motorola company logo.

The Motorola company doesn't exist anymore, becoming defunct on January 4th 2011. Reason: bankruptcy.
