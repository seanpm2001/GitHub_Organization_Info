# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-Forth-lang

## Description

For the development of my projects written in the Forth language, or containing Forth source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Forth-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Forth-lang)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in Forth. The original rule was that Forth had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any Forth code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

### Extra notes

Forth doesn't have an official logo, so I used the Forth Reddit subreddit logo.
