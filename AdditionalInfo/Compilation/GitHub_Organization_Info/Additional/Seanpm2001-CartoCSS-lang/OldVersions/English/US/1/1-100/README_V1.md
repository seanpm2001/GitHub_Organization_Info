This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in the CartoCSS programming language. The original rule was that CartoCSS had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any CartoCSS source code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

CartoCSS is the name of the language

CartoCSS is a recognized language by GitHub.

CartoCSS (short: Carto) is a language for map design. It is similar in syntax to CSS, but builds upon it with specific abilities to filter map data and by providing things like variables. It targets the Mapnik renderer and is able to generate Mapnik XML or a JSON variant of Mapnik XML. It can run from the command line or in the browser by using a bundler like Browserify. [`[Description from @MapBox///Ccrto/docs/index.rst]`](https://github.com/mapbox/carto/blob/master/docs/index.rst)

The current logo in use is in PNG format. This means that it is not transparent, but it does not need background color replacement. I used this image:

![CartoCSS_WideLogo.png](/AdditionalInfo/2/Seanpm2001-CartoCSS-lang/Unused/CartoCSS_WideLogo.png)

And used GIMP to make it a square image, rather than rectangle, so it would fit in the GitHub organization profile picture.

CartoCSS programs have the `.mss` file extensions.

CartoCSS is used in [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/)

The official GitHub organization for Cap'n Proto is located at [Mapbox](https://github.com/mapbox/)

<!-- I currently cannot figure out what file extension CartoCSS programs use. !-->

<!-- The logo currently in use is in GIF format, but is not animated.!-->

<!--I don't know what CartoCSS-lang stands for, in the sense of programming languages. !-->
