# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-QMake-lang

## Description

For the archival and development of my projects written in the QMake programming language, or containing QMake source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-QMake-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-QMake-lang/)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in the QMake programming language. The original rule was that QMake had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any QMake source code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

## Extra info

QMake is the name of the language.

QMake is a recognized language by GitHub.

QMake is a QT language.

The current logo in use is in PNG format. This means that it is transparent. It also does not have any background color issues.

I am using an old/unofficial QT logo for this project, as QMake doesn't seem to have its own logo.

QMake programs use the `.pro` file extension.

<!-- I currently cannot figure out what file extension QMake programs use. !-->

<!-- The logo currently in use is in GIF format, but is not animated.!-->

<!--I don't know what QMake-lang stands for, in the sense of programming languages. !-->

No other extra info available.
