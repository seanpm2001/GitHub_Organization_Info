# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-NASL-lang

## Description

For the archival and development of my projects written in the NASL programming language, or containing NASL source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-NASL-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-NASL-lang/)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in NASL. The original rule was that NASL had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any NASL code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

## Extra info

I discovered this language via GitHub.

NASL stands for **N**essus **A**ttack **S**cripting **L**anguage

<!-- NASL doesn't have an official logo, so I used the best alternative I could find. !-->
