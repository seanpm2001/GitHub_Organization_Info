This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in the AIDL programming language. The original rule was that AIDL had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any AIDL source code is included.

## Extra info

AIDL is the name of the language

AIDL is a recognized language by GitHub, but I can't find any AIDL source code since I logged this entry. The closest I can get now is mention of an Android library known as AIDL.

The current logo in use is in PNG format. This means that it is transparent, but it does not need background color replacement. I used a generic logo that was as close as I could get to resembling AIDL, as I couldn't find one.

AIDL programs have the `.aidl` file extensions (I think)

<!-- The official GitHub organization for AIDL is located at [QisKit](https://github.com/qiskit/)

> Link to the home repository (JavaScript, AIDL, Vim Script, other) [QisKit/AIDL](https://github.com/QISKit/AIDL/)

!-->

The cloest official GitHub organization for AIDL is located at [null](#Not-found)

> Link to the supposed home repository (other languages) [Null](#Not-found)

<!-- I currently cannot figure out what file extension AIDL programs use. !-->

<!-- The logo currently in use is in GIF format, but is not animated.!-->

I don't know what AIDL stands for, in the sense of programming languages.

No other extra info is currently available.
