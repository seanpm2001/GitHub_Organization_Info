# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-Inform-lang

## Description

For the development of my projects written in the Inform language, or containing Inform source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Inform-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Inform-lang)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in Vim Script. The original rule was that Inform had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any Inform code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

### Extra notes

The logo for Inform is pretty low quality. A scaled up or vector version would be nice in the future.
