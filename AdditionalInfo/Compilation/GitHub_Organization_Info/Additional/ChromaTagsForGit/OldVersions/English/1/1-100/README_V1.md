# GitHub organization: ChromaTagsForGit

## Description

My GitHub organization for the development of Chroma Tags for Git, a GitHub-Linguist-inspired tag generator.

## More info

[https://github.com/ChromaTagsForGit](https://github.com/ChromaTagsForGit)

This organization is used for the development of the Chroma Tags for Git software library, a library that sorts multiple types of many languages into a GitHub linguist-like tag system. In other words, this project uses linguist color coding for Git-based programming, and much more. Inspired by [GitHub Linguist](https://github.com/github/linguist)
