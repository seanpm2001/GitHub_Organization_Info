# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-Legacy

## Description

The Seanpm2001 GitHub organization for legacy software and media projects.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Legacy](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Legacy/)

This project hosts legacy projects (older projects with older architectures)

## Extra info

This is a category project.

The logo for this project is a simple wordmark with the text `Legacy` I couldn't find anything better. There are ways to improve this wordmark, I just didn't get to it today.

Due to issues with GitHub, this organization is currently empty, as I can't fork projects here at the moment.
