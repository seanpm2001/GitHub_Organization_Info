# GitHub organization: SNU-PFOSSExchange

## Description

For the archival and development of the SNU PFOSS Exchange project, the old SNU Private FOSS software exchange program.

## More info

[https://github.com/SNU-PFOSSExchange](https://github.com/SNU-PFOSSExchange)

This organization is used for the archival and development of the SNU PFOSS Exchange package, SNUs old place for the Private Free and Open Source Software exchange program, before SNU went nearly fully public.

## Extra notes

This is for holding segments of SNU source code that had been debranded and were deemed ready before the May 2020 decision. They are pretty much obsolete, unless you want to use it without branding.
