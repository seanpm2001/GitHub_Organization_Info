# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-SXML-lang

## Description

For the development of my projects written in the SXML language, or containing SXML source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-SXML-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-SXML-lang)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in SXML (S eXtensible Markup Language) The original rule was that SXML had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any SXML code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

### Extra notes

I used an image I considered unused a few days ago for this project, as there were no icons for SXML, but the language is close enough to XML to use another XML icon.
