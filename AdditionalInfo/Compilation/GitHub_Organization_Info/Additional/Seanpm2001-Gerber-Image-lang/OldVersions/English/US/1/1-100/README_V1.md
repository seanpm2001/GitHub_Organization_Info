# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-Gerber-Image-lang

## Description

For the archival and development of my projects written in the Gerber Image programming language, or containing Gerber Image source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Gerber-Image-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Gerber-Image-lang/)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in the Gerber-Image programming language. The original rule was that Gerber-Image had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any Gerber-Image source code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

## Extra info

Gerber Image is the name of the language.

Gerber Image is an image format, similar to SVG.

The language is named after [Joseph Gerber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Gerber) and has absolutely no relation to Nestl√©.

Gerber Image is a recognized language by GitHub, but must be enabled through a `.gitattributes` file first. Use the following source code to do so:

```gitattributes
# Gerber image
*.gbr linguist-detectable=true
*.gbr linguist-documentation=false
```

Gerber Image is sometimes confused with the [Solidity](/AdditionalInfo/2/Seanpm2001-Solidity-lang/) programming language by GitHub.

<!--The logo currently in use is in GIF format, but is not animated. !-->

<!--I don't know what Gerber-Image stands for, in the sense of programming languages. !-->

No other extra info available.
