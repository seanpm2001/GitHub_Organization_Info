# GitHub organization: CountMausoleum

## Description

For the development of Count Mausoleum, which is software and schematics for the future of mausoleums.

## More info

[https://github.com/CountMausoleum](https://github.com/CountMausoleum)

This organization is used for the archival and development of my Count Mausoleum software, which is for setting up the software and schematics for an advanced mausoleum, aiming to be the future of mausoleums.

## Extra info

I couldn't find a Skeuomorphic or glossy version of a mausoleum/grave related icon, so I unfortunately have to use a flat icon for now.
