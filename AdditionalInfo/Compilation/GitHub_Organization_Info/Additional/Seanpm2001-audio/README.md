# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-audio

## Description

For the archive and development of my audio related projects, under the Seanpm2001 name.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-audio](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-audio)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my audio related projects. It is a recreation of [seanwallawalla-audio](/AdditionalInfo/1/seanwallawalla-audio/) but with Seanpm2001 branding instead.

## Extra info

I would have loved to use the old iTunes logo for this organization, but I have to keep the stock image somewhat original, and not duplicate (unless it is a SNU project)
