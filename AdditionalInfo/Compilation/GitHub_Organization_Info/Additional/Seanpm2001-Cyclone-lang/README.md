# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-Cyclone-lang

## Description

For the archival and development of my projects written in the Cyclone programming language, or containing Cyclone source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Cyclone-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Cyclone-lang/)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in Cyclone. The original rule was that Cyclone had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any Cyclone code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

## Extra info

I am using an Emoji of a cyclone for this project, as the Cyclone language doesn't have its own logo as of 2021 Saturday November 27th.

Cyclone isn't officially recognized by GitHub yet, as of 2021 Saturday November 27th.
