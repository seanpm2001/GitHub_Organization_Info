For the development of my projects written in the Verilog AMS language, or containing Verilog AMS source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Verilog-AMS-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Verilog-AMS-lang)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in Verilog AMS. The original rule was that Verilog AMS had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any Verilog AMS code is included.
