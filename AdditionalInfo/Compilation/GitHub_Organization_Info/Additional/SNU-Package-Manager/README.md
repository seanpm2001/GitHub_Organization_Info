# GitHub organization: SNU-Package-Manager

## Description

The GitHub organization for the official SNU package manager.

## More info

[https://github.com/SNU-Package-Manager](https://github.com/SNU-Package-Manager/)

This project hosts archives and developments of the official SNU Package Manager.

## Extra info

The SNU Package Manager is a core SNU project.

This project is written mostly in Python.

This project uses the default SNU icon. I might use a modified logo in the future. Current plans: a detailed package icon with the SNU logo stamped on it.

The home repository for this project lies at [seanpm2001/SNU_Package_Manager](https://github.com/seanpm2001/SNU_Package_Manager/)
