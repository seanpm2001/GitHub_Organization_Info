# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-Arduino-lang

## Description

For the archival and development of my projects written in the Arduino programming language, or containing Arduino source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Arduino-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Arduino-lang/)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in Arduino. The original rule was that Arduino had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any Arduino code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

## Extra info

Arduino currently is recognized by GitHub, but has an error. When searching for it, it will default to `all` but will still show the linguist `* Arduino` label, then when you go to the project, the Arduino label data just goes to `Other`

I used a glossy skeuomorphic version of the logo, as the current one is too plain for me.

I have an Arduino kit, but it is missing parts, and is over 4 years old, so I don't know how well it works. I would likely want to start new if I were to get into this again.
