# GitHub organization: CompuBunker

## Description

For the archival and development of the computer bunker project, CompuBunker, or **[@Compunker](/AdditionalInfo/2/Compunker/)**

## More info

[https://github.com/CompuBunker](https://github.com/CompuBunker/)

This organization is used for the archival and development of my CompuBunker device protection bunker hardware installation, a disaster proof casing for your computer hard drives and equipments. This is not as much of a software project as it is a hardware project.

## Extra info

This project is still very early in development. I also can't produce any units yet.

The image I used contains a watermark, it was the best I could get. At certain scaling, the watermark is nearly impossible to make out.
