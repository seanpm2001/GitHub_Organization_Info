# GitHub organization: FloweredNotch

## Description

The organization for FloweredNotch, the first piece of Notchware, meant to replace the notched part of your screen with SFW patterns.

## More info

[https://github.com/FloweredNotch](https://github.com/FloweredNotch/)

This project hosts the archival and development of my project, FloweredNotch, which is the first piece of Notchware. It is meant to replace the section of your screen that is covered by a notch with friendly patterns, so that MalNotch can't override it.

## Extra info

This is not a category project.

The logo for this project is a black square emoji with an orange flower in the center, meant to resemble the flowers and other nice patterns being placed over the notched section of your screen.

This project contains 2 sub-projects:

- 1. [seanpm2001/FloweredNotch](https://github.com/seanpm2001/FloweredNotch/)
- 2. [seanpm2001/Notchware](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Notchware/)
<!-- - 3. [seanpm2001/MalNotch](https://github.com/seanpm2001/MalNotch/) !-->

Due to my inability to fork GitHub repositories outside of my own account at the moment, this organization is currently empty.

The homepage for this project is located [`here (seanpm2001/FloweredNotch`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/FloweredNotch/)

There is no current home repository for this project.
