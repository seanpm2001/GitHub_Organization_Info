## Extra info

This is a category project.

I am using a redder version of the Mozilla logo, as it looked good, and I didn't know what else to use.

This project is only for Mozilla licensed projects under the following licenses:

| License (SPDX) | License name |
|----|----|
| [`MPL-1.0`](https://spdx.org/licenses/MPL-1.0.html) | `Mozilla Public License 1.0` |

| [`MPL-2.0-no-copyleft-exception`](https://spdx.org/licenses/MPL-2.0-no-copyleft-exception.html) | `Mozilla Public License 2.0 (No Copyleft exception)` |

The only exception is the usual global repositories (such as the current repository `GitHub_Organization_Info` which is licensed under the GNU General Public License V3.0) and projects that give licensing info.

<!--
As of 2022, May 27th, I don't have any projects that use for this organization yet.

Due to my inability to fork GitHub repositories outside of my own account at the moment, this organization is empty.

The homepage for this project is located [`here (unavailable, there is no current home repository for this project)`](https://www.example.com)
