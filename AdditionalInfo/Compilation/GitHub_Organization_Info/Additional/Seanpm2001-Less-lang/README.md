# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-Less-lang

## Description

For the development of my projects written in the Less (CSS variant) language, or containing Less (CSS variant) source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Less-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Less-lang)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in Less. The original rule was that Less (CSS language variant) had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any Less (CSS language variant) code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

### Extra notes

The original logo for Less (CSS language variant) wouldn't fit in a square picture, so I chose an alternative simplified image.

Less is a CSS language variant. It is not the official CSS Language, but can be used as an alternative with simplified syntax.
