# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-IBM

## Description

The Seanpm2001 GitHub organization for my IBM related projects and forks.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-IBM](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-IBM/)

This project hosts projects that are IBM related projects and forks. They must either be by IBM (International Business Machines) or run on IBM technologies.

## Extra info

This is a category project.

The logo for this project is in JPEG format. It has a black opaque background, but for now, I feel it works well, maybe just putting a frame around it will correct it.

Due to issues with GitHub, this organization is currently empty, as I can't fork projects here at the moment.
