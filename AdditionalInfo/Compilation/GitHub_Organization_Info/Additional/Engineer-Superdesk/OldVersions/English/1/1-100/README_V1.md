# GitHub organization: Engineer-Superdesk

For the development of the Engineer Superdesk, a free and open source alternative to AutoDesk software products.

## More info

[https://github.com/Engineer-Superdesk](https://github.com/Engineer-Superdesk)

This organization is used for the archival and development of my software suite called the Engineer Superdesk, a free and open source alternative to AutoDesk software products. It is an open source recreation of the suite of AutoDesk modeling software. I used AutoDesk in my engineering class in High School, but was disappointed to find that there were no free or free and open source alternates to it.

### Extra notes

For now, I decided to use a stock photo of the Engineer from Team Fortress 2 by Valve as the picture for this organization, as I didn't want to use a generic Engineer picture, and I figured this would be humorous for now. The picture is based off the Engineer Gaming meme.
