# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-ML-lang

## Description

For the archival and development of my projects written in the ML programming language, or containing ML source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-ML-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-ML-lang/)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in the ML language. The original rule was that ML had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any ML source code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

## Extra info

ML is the name of the language. I can't find an official logo for ML, so I chose the closest one I could find.

ML commonly stands for "Machine Learning" but this language has a different acronym meaning, although I can't find it.

This is the megacategory for ML. It will include all variants of ML, including `Standard ML` `OCAML` `etc ML` etc.
