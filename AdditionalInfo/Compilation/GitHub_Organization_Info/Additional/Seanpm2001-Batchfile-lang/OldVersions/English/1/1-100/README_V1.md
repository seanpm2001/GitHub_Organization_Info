# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-Batchfile-lang

## Description

For the development of my projects written in the Batchfile language, or containing Batchfile source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Batchfile-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Batchfile-lang)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in Batchfile. The original rule was that Batchfile had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any Batchfile code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

## Extra info

The icon for Windows Batch files pre-Windows Vista was used, as I feel it fits best. Unfortunately, for some reason, I could only find 1 result of the icon itself, and it is extremely grainy. It is the best I have for now, I am not going through the process of creating a Windows XP virtual machine and extracting the icon for this, someone else can contribute to that.
