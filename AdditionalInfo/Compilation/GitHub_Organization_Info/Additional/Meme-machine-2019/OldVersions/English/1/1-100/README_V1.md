# GitHub organization: Meme-machine-2019

## Description

For the development of my 2019 meme machine software. I couldn't find a good icon at the moment, sorry.

## More info

[https://github.com/Meme-machine-2019](https://github.com/Meme-machine-2019)

This organization is used for the development of the Meme machine 2019 edition meme generating project. It is an old abandoned project.

### Extra notes

I used the closest neutral icon I could for this project that was meme related. I didn't want to use a meme as the icon for the project, as it may look too out of date, or may become a hate symbol in the future. I used the logo of a random meme generator that didn't use a meme in its icon.
