This organization is used for the development of the SNU WeatherVane module, which is SNUs implementation of a web-based weather application. It is used as a trustable replacement for other web services for when they make bad changes, and is mainly SNUs way of showing you what the weather is, but in much higher depth than a traditional simplified Weather app.
