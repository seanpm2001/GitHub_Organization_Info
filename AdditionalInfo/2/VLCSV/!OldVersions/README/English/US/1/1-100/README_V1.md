# GitHub organization: VLCSV

## Description

The GitHub organization for the archival and development of VLCSV, a CSV (Comma Separated Values) support LIBrary for VLC Media Player.

## More info

[https://github.com/VLCSV](https://github.com/VLCSV/)

This project hosts the archival and development of the VLCSV project, a software library for VLC Media Player that adds support for CSV (Comma Separated Values) to better categorize projects.

## Extra info

This is a normal project.

This project is very early in development, and is not functional yet. It needs more backers and developers.

The logo for this project is in PNG format. It was based off an existing logo, and has been modified to fit the project. It does not need a replacement logo at the moment.

I am using the VLC Traffic cone icon on this projects logo. I am not affiliated with VLC Media Player, but I would like to be. It was used to indicate this being a VLC addon, but it is not made by VideoLan or the current VideoLan community. In other words, it is an unofficial project.

This project is written in Lua, MoonScript, and CSV. These seem to be the best languages to use, as VLC supports them for plugin development. I considered using Rust and C#, but decided not to yet. C# would have been used for a Windows specific port, and Rust would be used as a backup language.

Due to issues with GitHub, this organization is currently empty, as I can't fork projects here at the moment.

The homepage for this project is located [`here`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/VLCSV/).
