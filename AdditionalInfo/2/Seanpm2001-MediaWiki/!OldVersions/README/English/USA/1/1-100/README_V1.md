# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-MediaWiki

## Description

The Seanpm2001 GitHub organization for the archival and development of MediaWiki related projects and forks.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-MediaWiki](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-MediaWiki/)

This project hosts the development and archival of projects and forks related to the MediaWiki project.

## Extra info

This is a category project.

I am using the old MediaWiki logo for this project, as I don't like the 2020 April 1st logo.

This category is for all my `MediaWiki` projects and forks.

<!--
As of 2022, May 27th, I don't have any projects that use for this organization yet.
!-->

Due to my inability to fork GitHub repositories outside of my own account at the moment, this organization is empty.

The homepage for this project is located [`here (unavailable, there is no current home repository for this project)`](https://www.example.com)
