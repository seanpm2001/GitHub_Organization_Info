# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-Ballerina-lang

## Description

For the archival and development of my projects written in the Ballerina programming language, or containing Ballerina source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Ballerina-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Ballerina-lang/)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in the Ballerina programming language. The original rule was that Ballerina had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any Ballerina source code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

## Extra info

Ballerina is the name of the language.

Ballerina is a recognized language by GitHub.

The Ballerina language is written mostly in Java, and is owned by a company named WSO2

The current logo in use is in JPEG format. This means that it is not transparent, but it still looks good in light or dark mode, due to how it is laid out.

<!-- The logo currently in use is in GIF format, but is not animated.!-->

<!--I don't know what Ballerina-lang stands for, in the sense of programming languages. !-->
