# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-OCaml-Lang

## Description

For the development of my projects written in the OCaml language, or containing OCaml source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-OCaml-Lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-OCaml-Lang)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in OCaml. The original rule was that OCaml had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any OCaml code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

## Extra info

Not to be confused with CAML.
