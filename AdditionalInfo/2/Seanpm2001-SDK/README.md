# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-SDK

## Description

The Seanpm2001 GitHub organization for software development kit (SDK) projects.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-SDK](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-SDK/)

This project hosts archives and developments of my SDK (**S**oftware **D**evelopment **K**it) projects

## Extra info

The logos in use on this logo are not the only languages used in the SDK projects here.

This organization is currently empty, as I am unable to fork projects at the moment.
