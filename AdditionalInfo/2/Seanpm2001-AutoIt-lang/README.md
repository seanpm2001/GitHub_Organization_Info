# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-AutoIt-lang

## Description

For the archival and development of my projects written in the AutoIt programming language, or containing AutoIt source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-AutoIt-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-AutoIt-lang/)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in the AutoIt programming language. The original rule was that AutoIt had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any AutoIt source code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

## Extra info

AutoIt is the name of the language.

AutoIt is currently a Windows-only language unfortunately.

I am currently using the V3 logo, as it looks good, and was the easiest to find.

AutoIt is a recognized language by GitHub, as of 2022 February 25th.

<!--The logo currently in use is in GIF format, but is not animated. !-->

<!--I don't know what AutoIt stands for, in the sense of programming languages. !-->

No other extra info available.
