# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-Orwell-lang

## Description

For the archival and development of my projects written in the Orwell programming language, or containing Orwell source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Orwell-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Orwell-lang/)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in the Orwell programming language. The original rule was that Orwell had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any Orwell source code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

## Extra info

Orwell is the name of the language. It is named after the author of the book Nineteen Eighty-Four (George Orwell) as the language was released in the year 1984, and its creators thought this would be a good idea.

I am using a sticker of George Orwell as the logo for this project. I don't think that logos or mentions of Nineteen Eighty-Four would fit as well here.

Orwell is a precursor to the Haskell programming language.

Orwell used to be the primary language at Oxford University in Oxford England for computer science courses.

<!-- The logo currently in use is in GIF format, but is not animated. !-->

Orwell is currently not officially recognized as a language by GitHub (as of 2022 Friday, February 18th) although it has a decent Wikipedia article, but no source code examples there.

I am referring to Nineteen Eighty-Four in full words, as that is how you are supposed to reference it as to avoid confusion with the year 1984 CE, and because that is the actual title of the book.
