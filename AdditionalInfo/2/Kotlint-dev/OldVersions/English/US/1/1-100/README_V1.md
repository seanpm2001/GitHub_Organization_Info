# GitHub organization: Kotlint-dev

## Description

The organization for Kotlint, a collection of Kotlin linter/linting projects.

## More info

[https://github.com/Kotlint-dev](https://github.com/Kotlint-dev/)

This project hosts archives and developments of Kotlin linter projects.

## Extra info

The logo in use is an uncommon variant of the Kotlin logo, as I already used the Kotlin logo for another project.

This organization is currently empty, as I am unable to fork projects at the moment.
