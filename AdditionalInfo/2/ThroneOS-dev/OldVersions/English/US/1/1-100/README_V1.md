# GitHub organization: ThroneOS-dev

## Description

The GitHub organization for ThroneOS, an open source basic operating system for toilets, part of the @bathhouseos project. Written in nesC, Verilog for TinyOS.

## More info

[https://github.com/ThroneOS-dev](https://github.com/ThroneOS-dev/)

This project is for archives and developments of the subproject of BathHouseOS, known as ThroneOS, which is a toilet operating system.

## Extra info

This project uses a generic toilet logo. It may be changed in the future.

The name [`ThroneOS`](https://github.com/ThroneOS/) was already taken, but was in use by a user not making use of the name.

This project is a subproject of the [@bathhouseos](/AdditionalInfo/2/BathHouseOS/) project.

The term `Throne` is used, as `ToiletOS` would be too generic. A toilet is sometimes called a throne, so it was used. This operating system is designed to run on your porcelain throne, or whatever your toilet is made from.

The description was cut off due to a character limit. The last line should read:

```plain-text
Written in nesC and Verilog, designed for TinyOS.
```

Since I can't fork projects at the moment, this organization is currently empty.

The home repository for this project, lies at [seanpm2001/SankOS](https://github.com/seanpm2001/SankOS/)
