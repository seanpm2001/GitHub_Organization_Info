# GitHub organization: Turkey-Stories

## Description

For the archival and development of the Turkey Stories game and story project.

## More info

[https://github.com/Turkey-Stories](https://github.com/Turkey-Stories/)

This organization is used for the archival and development of a video game and story set involving the Genus Turkey (bird) due to its low representation in media, and it being my favorite animal.

## Extra info

This project is written in GoDot, I feel like GDScript will be the staple language for my gaming projects for the near future.

I was going to start this project later in the year (September 1st) but decided to start it on August 25th 2021 to have more time to plan.

November is NOT the target release month. That is not what this project is about.
