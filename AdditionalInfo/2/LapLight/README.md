## Description

LapLight is a device specification for flashlight functionality on a laptop, for convenience, or when you don't have other devices handy.

## More info

[https://github.com/LapLight](https://github.com/LapLight/)

This project hosts archives and developments of the laplight device specification that adds and supports flashlights on laptops, netbooks, and other portable computers that don't already have them.

## Extra info

This project is still a work in progress.

This project is written in C, as C is the most common usable language for supporting various hardware vendors software.

I have yet to choose an official icon for this project.
