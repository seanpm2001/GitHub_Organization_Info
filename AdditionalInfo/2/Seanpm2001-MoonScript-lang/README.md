# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-MoonScript-lang

## Description

For the archival and development of my projects written in the MoonScript programming language, or containing MoonScript source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-MoonScript-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-MoonScript-lang/)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in the MoonScript programming language. The original rule was that MoonScript had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any MoonScript source code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

## Extra info

MoonScript is the name of the language.

MoonScript is a recognized language by GitHub.

MoonScript is a language that compiles to Lua. Its syntax is inspired by the CoffeeScript language.

The current logo in use is in JPEG format. This means that it is not transparent, but it needs a replacement without a solid white background.

I am using a generic moon logo, as MoonScript doesn't appear to have its own logo.

MoonScript programs have the `.moon` file extension.

<!-- The logo currently in use is in GIF format, but is not animated.!-->

<!--I don't know what MoonScript-lang stands for, in the sense of programming languages. !-->

No other extra info available.
