# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-Learn

## Description

The Seanpm2001 GitHub organization for my 'learn' projects, a place where I archive and develop my complete knowledge of programming, and other skills.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Learn](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Learn/)

This project hosts the development and archival of projects and forks related to my learn projects, which most notably are collections of my complete knowledge on programming languages. It is expected to expand into future subjects in the future.

## Extra info

This is not a a category project.

I am using a generic logo for this project, there aren't too many good ones to represent it. I am using the logo of a 3D Magenta button with white text `LEARN` on it.

This category is for all my `Learn` projects and forks.

<!--
