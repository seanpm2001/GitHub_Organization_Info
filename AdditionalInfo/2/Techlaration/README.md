# GitHub organization: Techlaration

## Description

The organization for the Techlaration revival project.

## More info

[https://github.com/Techlaration](https://github.com/Techlaration/)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects based on the Techlaration brand.

## Extra info

I have had the techlaration brand name since 2014/2015. There were some controversies with the name when it got leaked in the family, and I was harassed for a bit, and then I was shown that "it already exists"

I have checked back in 2021 on October 28th, and have found that the name isn't taken, and it is hardly mentioned. Just because it comes up in the search results doesn't mean it exists, I wasn't able to find any uses of it in a site or brand name, and only found 2 vague mentions of it.

The brand will be revived, there are some unique puns that can be made with it, such as the techlaration of independance, but I don't see much use in it now. It was the original company name to host the Meadows project, along with a lot of other projects.

There is a treasure trove of old content that can be uploaded now, dating back even further (before 2016) down all the way to 2014.
