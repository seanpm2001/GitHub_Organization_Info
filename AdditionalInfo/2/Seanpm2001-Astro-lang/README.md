This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in the Astro programming language. The original rule was that Astro had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any Astro source code is included.

## Extra info

<details open><summary><p lang="en">Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section</p></summary>

Astro is the name of the language

Astro is a recognized language by GitHub.

The current logo in use is in PNG format. This means that it is transparent, but it may need background color replacement. I am using the official Astro logo, which has a black background.

Astro programs have the `.astro` file extension.

The official GitHub organization for Astro is located at [WithAstro](https://github.com/WithAstro/)

<!-- The logo currently in use is in GIF format, but is not animated.!-->

<!--I don't know what Astro-lang stands for, in the sense of programming languages. !-->
