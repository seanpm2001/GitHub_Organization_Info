# GitHub organization: WacOS-OnESTEP

## Description

The GitHub organization for OnESTEP, an open source remake of NeXTSTEP/OpenSTEP. Part of the WacOS operating system project.

## More info

[https://github.com/WacOS-OnESTEP](https://github.com/WacOS-OnESTEP/)

This project hosts the archival and development of my project, WacOS-OnESTEP, which is a subsystem of the WacOS project that aims to imitate/recreate the NeXTSTEP/OpenSTEP operating system. It is currently very early in development, and is not functional yet.

## Extra info

This is not a category project.

The logo for this project is a custom logo, consisting of text with a Q*bert pattern, saying `OnESTEP` along with the WacOS `W` (aquatic) logo above it, with a `1` above it (symbolizing the `OnE` `STEP` that is being taken forward) along with the NeXT logo to the side, with the Previous (NeXT emulator) logo above it, to represent the Yin and Yang of the Apple variant, and the open source variant.

Due to my inability to fork GitHub repositories outside of my own account at the moment, this organization is currently empty.

The homepage for this project is located [`here (seanpm2001/WacOS-OnESTEP`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS_OnESTEP/)
