# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-FileSystems

## Description

The Seanpm2001 GitHub organization for file system projects.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-FileSystems](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-FileSystems/)

This project is for archives and developments of my projects and forks of file system projects.

## Extra info

This project uses the logo for the KDE Dolphin file manager, as it represents the project well.

Projects that fit this category include: Dolphin file manager (KDE) Nautilus file manager (GNOME) Scarlet Oven (seanpm2001) and other related projects.

Since I can't fork projects at the moment, this organization is currently empty.
