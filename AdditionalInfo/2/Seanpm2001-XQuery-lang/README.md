# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-XQuery-lang

## Description

For the archival and development of my projects written in the XQuery programming language, or containing XQuery source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-XQuery-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-XQuery-lang/)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in the XQuery programming language. The original rule was that XQuery had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any XQuery source code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

## Extra info

XQuery is the name of the language.

XQuery is a recognized language by GitHub.

I am using a generic XML logo, as I couldn't find an XQuery logo online.

<!-- The current logo in use is in JPEG format. This means that it is not transparent, but it needs a replacement without a solid white background. !-->

XQuery programs have several file extensions. The following extensions are used: `xq` `.xql` `.xqm` `.xqy` `.xquery`

<!-- The logo currently in use is in GIF format, but is not animated.!-->

<!--I don't know what XQuery-lang stands for, in the sense of programming languages. !-->

No other extra info available.
