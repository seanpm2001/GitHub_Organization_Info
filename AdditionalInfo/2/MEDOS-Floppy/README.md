# GitHub organization: MEDOS-Floppy

## Description

The GitHub organization for MEDOS Floppy, the virtual floppy diskette variant of the MEDOS operating system. Part of the Meadows operating system project.

## More info

[https://github.com/MEDOS-Floppy](https://github.com/MEDOS-Floppy/)

This project hosts the archival and development of the MEDOS subproject, MEDOS Floppy, a variant of MEDOS meant to be run directly off a virtual floppy disk drive.

## Extra info

This is not a category project.

The logo for this project is a floppy disk icon with the dark green `MEDOS` wordmark above it, and the text:

- Floppy Disk
- Operating System

Below the floppy disk in a cool blue texture,

This is the lowest tier storage device that MEDOS can operate on. The next level up is [`MEDOS HDD`](/AdditionalInfo/2/MEDOS-HDD/)

Due to my inability to fork GitHub repositories outside of my own account at the moment, this organization is currently empty.

The homepage for this project is located [`here (seanpm2001/MEDOS-Floppy`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/MEDOS-Floppy/)
