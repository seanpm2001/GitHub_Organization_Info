# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-Joy-lang

## Description

For the archival and development of my projects written in the Joy programming language, or containing Joy source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Joy-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Joy-lang/)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in Joy. The original rule was that Joy had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any Joy code is included.

## Extra info

Joy doesn't have its own logo, so I used a transparent text logo. I later found out it had 2 white curly brackets, which are really hard to see on a white background.
