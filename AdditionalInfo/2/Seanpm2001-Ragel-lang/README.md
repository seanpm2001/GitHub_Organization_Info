# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-Ragel-lang

## Description

For the archival and development of my projects written in the Ragel programming language, or containing Ragel source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Ragel-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Ragel-lang/)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in the Ragel programming language. The original rule was that Ragel had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any Ragel source code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

## Extra info

Ragel is the name of the language.

I don't know where to find the original logo for this language, as it may not have one, so I found an icon with the letter R, as it is as close as I can get for now.

Ragel is a recognized language by GitHub, as of 2022 February 25th.

<!--The logo currently in use is in GIF format, but is not animated. !-->

<!--I don't know what Ragel stands for, in the sense of programming languages.!-->

No other extra info available.
