# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-Hope-lang

## Description

For the archival and development of my projects written in the Hope programming language, or containing Hope source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Hope-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Hope-lang/)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in the Hope programming language. The original rule was that Hope had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any Hope source code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

## Extra info

Hope is the name of the language. I can't find an official logo for Standard ML, so I chose the closest one I could find.

The logo currently in use is in GIF format, but is not animated.

Hope is currently not officially recognized as a language by GitHub (as of 2022 Friday, February 18th) although it has a decent Wikipedia article.
