# GitHub organization: WhyWatchOS

## Description

The GitHub organization for WhyWatchOS, an open source remake of Apples WatchOS. Part of the WacOS operating system project.

## More info

[https://github.com/WhyWatchOS](https://github.com/WhyWatchOS/)

This project hosts the archival and development of my project, WhyWatchOS, which is a subsystem of the WacOS project that aims to imitate/recreate the WatchOS series of Apple operating systems. It is currently very early in development, and is not functional yet.

## Extra info

This is not a category project.

The logo for this project is a custom logo, consisting of the `WhyWatchOS` wordmark on a Gr√¶y paper background. It is a bit hard to read from a distance.

Due to my inability to fork GitHub repositories outside of my own account at the moment, this organization is currently empty.

The homepage for this project is located [`here (seanpm2001/WhyWatchOS`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WhyWatchOS/)
