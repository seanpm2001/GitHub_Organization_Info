# GitHub organization: MaprilOS

## Description

The GitHub organization for MaprilOS, an open source operating system for showers, part of the @bathhouseos project. Written in nesC, Verilog for TinyOS.

## More info

[https://github.com/MaprilOS](https://github.com/MaprilOS/)

This project is for archives and developments of the subproject of BathHouseOS, known as MaprilOS, which is a shower operating system.

## Extra info

This project uses a generic shower logo. It may be changed in the future.

<!-- The name [`UriOS`](https://github.com/UriOS/) was already taken, but was in use by a user not making use of the name. !-->

This project is a subproject of the [@bathhouseos](/AdditionalInfo/2/BathHouseOS/) project.

Mapril is an old portmanteau I made in Elementary School. It is a combination of May and April. It is used as this microOS's name, because **April** **Showers** bring **May** flowers.

The description was cut off due to a character limit. The last line should read:

```plain-text
Written in nesC and Verilog, designed for TinyOS.
```

Since I can't fork projects at the moment, this organization is currently empty.

The home repository for this project, lies at [seanpm2001/MaprilOS](https://github.com/seanpm2001/MaprilOS/)
