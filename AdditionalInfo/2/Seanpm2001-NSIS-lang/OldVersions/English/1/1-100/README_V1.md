# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-NSIS-lang

## Description

For the archival and development of my projects written in the NSIS programming language, or containing NSIS source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-NSIS-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-NSIS-lang/)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in NSIS. The original rule was that NSIS had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any NSIS code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

## Extra info

I discovered this language via GitHub.

I do not know what NSIS stands for.

NSIS doesn't have an official logo, so I used the best alternative I could find. It would be good if it didn't have the download icon.
