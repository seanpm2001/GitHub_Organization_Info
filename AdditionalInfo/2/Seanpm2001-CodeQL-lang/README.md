# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-CodeQL-lang

## Description

For the archival and development of my projects written in the CodeQL programming language, or containing CodeQL source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-CodeQL-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-CodeQL-lang/)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in CodeQL. The original rule was that CodeQL had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any CodeQL code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

## Extra info

I discovered this language via the GitHub repository.

CodeQL doesn't have an official logo, so I used the best alternative I could find.
