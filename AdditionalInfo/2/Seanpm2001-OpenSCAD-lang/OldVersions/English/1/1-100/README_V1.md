# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-OpenSCAD-lang

## Description

For the archival and development of my projects written in the OpenSCAD programming language, or containing OpenSCAD source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-OpenSCAD-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-OpenSCAD-lang/)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in OpenSCAD. The original rule was that OpenSCAD had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any OpenSCAD code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

## Extra info

I discovered this language via GitHub.

<!-- OpenSCAD doesn't have an official logo, so I used the best alternative I could find. !-->
