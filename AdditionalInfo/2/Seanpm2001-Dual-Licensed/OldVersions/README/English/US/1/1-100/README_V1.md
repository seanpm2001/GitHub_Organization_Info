# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-Dual-Licensed

## Description

The Seanpm2001 GitHub organization for my dual-licensed projects and forks.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Dual-Licensed](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Dual-Licensed/)

This project hosts the development and archival of projects that are dual-licensed (are licensed with 2 or more software licenses)

## Extra info

This is a category project.

I am using a wordmark of the word dual for this projects logo. It should be changed in the future, because, despite being a PNG image, it has some flaws (but has transparency)

This category is for all my Dual-Licensed projects and forks. I only know of 3 at the moment:

1. [`seanpm2001/SNU_2D_ProgrammingTools_IDE_TOML`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/SNU_2D_ProgrammingTools_IDE_TOML) 

2. [`seanpm2001/KhanAcademyData_u-Seanwallawallaofficial`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/KhanAcademyData_u-Seanwallawallaofficial)

3. [`seanpm2001/SNU_2D_ProgrammingTools`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/SNU_2D_ProgrammingTools/)

<!--
As of 2022, May 27th, I don't have any projects that use for this organization yet.

Due to my inability to fork GitHub repositories outside of my own account at the moment, this organization is empty.

The homepage for this project is located [`here (unavailable, there is no current home repository for this project)`](https://www.example.com)
