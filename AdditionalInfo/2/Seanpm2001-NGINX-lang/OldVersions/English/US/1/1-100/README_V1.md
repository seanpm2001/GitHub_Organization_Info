# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-NGINX-lang

## Description

For the archival and development of my projects written in the NGINX programming language, or containing NGINX source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-NGINX-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-NGINX-lang/)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in the NGINX programming language. The original rule was that NGINX had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any NGINX source code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

## Extra info

NGINX is the name of the language.

NGINX is a recognized language by GitHub.

This organization is for the NGINX language, which is not to be confused with the NGINX software itself, or the server.

NGINX is also stylized as `NGIИX` but I couldn't do this for the organization name due to the Cyrillic character `И`.

The current logo in use is in PNG format. This means that it is transparent. It also doesn't have any background color issues.

NGINX programs use the `.conf` file extension.

NGINX is pronounced as `Engine X` and not `En Jinx`

<!-- I currently cannot figure out what file extension NGINX programs use. !-->

<!-- The logo currently in use is in GIF format, but is not animated.!-->

I don't know what NGINX-lang stands for, in the sense of programming languages.

No other extra info available.
