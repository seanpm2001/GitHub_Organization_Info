This organization is used for the archival and development of the SNU Protest ToolKit package, SNUs place for setting up and performing Internet-based protests, including blackouts, site messages spreading the word of an issue, and more.

## Extra notes

Only to be used in the most serious offenses. Notable past protests include the justified blackouts for protesting SOPA (Stop Online Piracy Act, 2012, USA origin) PIPA (Protect IP Act, 2012, USA origin) The Communications Decency Act (1996, USA origin, which led to the first worldwide Internet protest, dubbed the Black World Wide Web protest) and more.

If anybody misueses these protest toolkits for non-serious issues, please report it and protest them by stopping the use of that SNU distribution. Misuse includes blacking out the site because a moderator on the site got upset and wanted to cause a big deal over it, or the site was blacked out "for the luls" etc. this is a serious tool, and it has serious power. With great power, comes great responsibility. Use this power wisely.
