# GitHub organization: WacPaint

## Description

The GitHub organization for WacPaint, an open source alternative to MacPaint. Part of the WacOS operating system project.

## More info

[https://github.com/WacPaint](https://github.com/WacPaint/)

This project hosts the archival and development of the WacOS subproject, WacPaint, which is an open source alternative and recreation of MacPaint.

## Extra info

This is not a category project.

I used the original MacPaint logo for this project, but heavily modified it. I put some work into the design, putting the subtext `WacPaint` and filling in several pixels with individual patterns. I used as many patterns as possible on the design.

Due to my inability to fork GitHub repositories outside of my own account at the moment, this organization is currently empty.

The homepage for this project is located [`here (seanpm2001/WacPaint`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacPaint/)
