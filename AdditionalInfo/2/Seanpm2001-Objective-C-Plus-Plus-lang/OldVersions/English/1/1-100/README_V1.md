# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-Objective-C-Plus-Plus-lang

## Description

For the archival and development of my projects written in the Objective-C++ programming language, or containing Objective-C++ source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Objective-C-Plus-Plus-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Objective-C-Plus-Plus-lang/)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in Objective-C-Plus-Plus. The original rule was that Objective-C-Plus-Plus had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any Objective-C-Plus-Plus code is included.

## Extra info

I couldn't find a good logo for Objective-C++ so for now, I am just using an Objective-C logo I found that is free of copyright. It will be replaced in the future, even if that means just adding the string `++` to the image.
