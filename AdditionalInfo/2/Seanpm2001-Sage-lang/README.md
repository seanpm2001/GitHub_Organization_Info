This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in the Sage programming language. The original rule was that Sage had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any Sage source code is included.

## Extra info

<details open><summary><p lang="en">Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section</p></summary>

Sage is the name of the language

Sage is a recognized language by GitHub.

I don't know who develops the Sage programming language.

The current logo in use is in JPEG format. This means that it is not transparent, but it does not need background color replacement. I am using a generic logo, as Sage doesn't appear to have its own logo.

Sage programs have the `.sage` file extension.

The closest official GitHub organization for Sage is located at [Microsoft](https://github.com/microsoft/)

<!-- I currently cannot figure out what file extension Sage programs use. !-->

<!-- The logo currently in use is in GIF format, but is not animated.!-->

<!--I don't know what Sage-lang stands for, in the sense of programming languages. !-->

No other extra info is currently available.
