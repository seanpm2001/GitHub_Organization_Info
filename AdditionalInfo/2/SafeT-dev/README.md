This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my SafeT project, which is a plugin for various Linux terminals that makes the terminal alot safer to the general public (if you want to let them use your computer without locking the terminal completely) and also to make it safer for your own use, by banning commands like `sudo rm -rf -no-preserve-root` `chmod 777` and so on.

## Extra info
