## More info

[https://github.com/SNU-Snapchat-Mode](https://github.com/SNU-Snapchat-Mode/)

This project hosts archives and developments of the SNU Snapchat mode module/package, which is SNUs implementation of the Snapchat platform.

## Extra info

This project is still very early in development.

Some of the key differences between the SNU Snapchat module and Snapchat itself is:

- [x] This project is open source
- [x] This project doesn't contain privacy risks (such as data mining, trackers, etc.)

This project is currently written in JavaScript, but might change in the future.

This project uses the default SNU icon. I might use a modified logo in the future, but I currently don't have plans for it.

The home repository for this project (in 2D mode) lies at [seanpm2001/SNU_2D_SnapchatMode](https://github.com/seanpm2001/SNU_2D_SnapchatMode/)
