# GitHub organization: BaSYS-dev

## Description

The GitHub organization for the BaSYS subsystem, a set of open source alternatives to classic MacOS. Part of the WacOS operaitng system project

## More info

[https://github.com/BaSYS-dev](https://github.com/BaSYS-dev/)

This project hosts the archival and development of a set of subprojects for WacOS that are basic DOS (Disk Operating System(s)) which are a set of subsystems of the WacOS project that aims to imitate/recreate Apple DOS and related DOS apple projects. It is currently very early in development, and is not functional yet.

## Extra info

This is not a category project.

This is a duplicate of [`@WacOS-BaSYS`](/AdditionalInfo/2/WacOS-BaSYS/) with a different name.

Originally, I forgot that I had already made a logo for BaSYS, so a second one was created for this project. The new logo is 3 rows of text:

- WacOS
- BaSYS
- Subsystem

Each row has a different style applied to it. Side note: I recently learned that you can hold down the mouse and apply a pattern to various areas, instead of individually clicking each one to fill it with a color/pattern (using GIMP 2.10.28)

The following projects are part of this project:

### Operating systems

- [WacOS BaSYS (general)](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS_BaSYS/)
- [WacOS BaSYS 1](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS_BaSYS_1/)
- [WacOS BaSYS 2](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS_BaSYS_2/)
- [WacOS BaSYS 3](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS_BaSYS_3/)
- [WacOS BaSYS 4](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS_BaSYS_4/)
- [WacOS BaSYS 5](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS_BaSYS_5/)
- [WacOS BaSYS 6](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS_BaSYS_6/)

### Software list

This list is incomplete.

Due to my inability to fork GitHub repositories outside of my own account at the moment, this organization is currently empty.

The homepage for this project is located [`here (seanpm2001/WacOS_BaSYS)`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS_BaSYS/)
