# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-Vim

## Description

The Seanpm2001 GitHub organization for Vim related projects and forks.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Vim](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Vim/)

This project hosts the development and archival of projects related to the Vim Text Editor.

## Extra info

This is a category project.

I am using a different, unofficial Vim logo for this project, as I already have multiple Vim organizations, and I don't want to use the same logo for each one.

This category is for all my Vim projects and forks.

<!-- As of 2022, May 27th, I don't have any projects that use for this organization yet. !-->

Due to my inability to fork GitHub repositories outside of my own account at the moment, this organization is empty.

<!--
There is no current home repository for this project.
