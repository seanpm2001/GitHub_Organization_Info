# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-POV-Ray-SDL-lang

## Description

For the archival and development of my projects written in the POV-Ray-SDL programming language, or containing POV-Ray-SDL source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-POV-Ray-SDL-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-POV-Ray-SDL-lang/)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in the POV-Ray SDL programming language. The original rule was that POV Ray-SDL had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any POV Ray-SDL source code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

## Extra info
