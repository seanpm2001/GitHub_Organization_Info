# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-HCL-lang

## Description

For the archival and development of my projects written in the HCL programming language, or containing HCL source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-HCL-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-HCL-lang/)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in HCL. The original rule was that HCL had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any HCL code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

## Extra info

I don't know what HCL stands for.

This project uses a generic logo. I don't know if HCL has an official one or not.
