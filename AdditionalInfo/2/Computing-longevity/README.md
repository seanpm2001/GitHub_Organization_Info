# GitHub organization: Computing-longevity

## Description

A project to help the world produce hardware that lasts decades, and software that can last past the end of time. A standardization organization.

## More info

[https://github.com/Computing-longevity](https://github.com/Computing-longevity/)

This organization is used for the archival and development of a series of standards related to longevity in computer software and hardware, aimed at making computers last as long as possible, and software lasting until the end of time.

## Extra info

These are important standards I have been planning for months to fight planned obsolescence, and make more durable computers and computer software (cough Windows activation cough activation servers down forever cough can't run in a virtual machine cough registry can't be brute forced easily) I have finalized the plans 2 days ago (August 18th 2021) and put them into effect today (2021, August 20th 2021)

I will certify hardware and software that meets these standards.

You must join the program to follow the rules. The rules are mandatory if you want your product/project to be certified in this field. If you are not part of the project, you don't have to follow the rules, but you should at least consider the future of software and hardware, and the environment (iPhone landfills are not good for the world, billions of computers are thrown away each year, we can make the world last past the year 2050 if we do something) until laws go into effect that outlaw planned obsolescence
