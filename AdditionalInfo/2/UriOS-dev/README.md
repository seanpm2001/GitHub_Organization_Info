# GitHub organization: UriOS-dev

## Description

The GitHub organization for UriOS, an open source basic operating system for urinals, part of the [@bathhouseos](https://github.com/BathHouseOS/) project. Written in nesC, Verilog for TinyOS.

## More info

[https://github.com/UriOS-dev](https://github.com/UriOS-dev/)

This project is for archives and developments of the subproject of BathHouseOS, known as UriOS, which is a urinal operating system.

## Extra info

This project uses a generic urinal logo. It may be changed in the future.

The name [`UriOS`](https://github.com/UriOS/) was already taken, but was in use by a user not making use of the name.

This project is a subproject of the [@bathhouseos](/AdditionalInfo/2/BathHouseOS/) project.

Be careful when searching this project up, due to a similar sounding term `Yuri` which is a Japanese romance genre, which sometimes features lesbianism and sexual content. I previously noted that it was only a Lesbian genre, but I would like to point out there is more to it than just that. Just be careful searching it up. If you are in public, make sure safe mode is set to either `strict` or `moderate`

The description was cut off due to a character limit. The last line should read:

```plain-text
Written in nesC and Verilog, designed for TinyOS.
```

Since I can't fork projects at the moment, this organization is currently empty.

The home repository for this project, lies at [seanpm2001/UriOS](https://github.com/seanpm2001/UriOS/)
