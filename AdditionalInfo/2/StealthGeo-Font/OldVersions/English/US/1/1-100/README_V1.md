# GitHub organization: StealthGeo-Font

## Description

The GitHub organization for the stealth Geo Font specification, a font designed to be a mix of analog and digital, in a stealthy fashion.

## More info

[https://github.com/StealthGeo-Font](https://github.com/StealthGeo-Font/)

This project is for archives and developments of the StealthGeo typeface, a font I designed that is a mix of analog and digital, with a hint of stealth. No curves are used in this font.

## Extra info

This project uses a highly detailed font box icon, because I didn't know what else to use.

Since I can't fork projects at the moment, this organization is currently empty.

The home repository for this project, lies at [seanpm2001/StealthGeo-Font](https://github.com/seanpm2001/StealthGeo-Font/)
