Fixed description:

Project Aquarius is an open community of marine biology software and digital works.

This project hosts archives and developments of the project aquarius project, an open community of marine biology software, and other digital works in the field of marine biology, and aquatics.

## Extra info

Project Aquarius is a landing page for several projects, and isn't very much a project itself other than for this purpose.

This project currently uses the aquarius zodiac sign for its logo, as this project branched off from the [AquariOS](/AdditionalInfo/2/AquariOS-dev/) project, as the similarity was pointed out (I don't research Zodiac signs very often)

The home repository for this project lies at [seanpm2001/Project-Aquarius](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Project-Aquarius/)
