# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-AssemblyScript-lang

## Description

For the archival and development of my projects written in the AssemblyScript programming language, or containing AssemblyScript source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-AssemblyScript-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-AssemblyScript-lang/)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in AssemblyScript. The original rule was that AssemblyScript had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any AssemblyScript code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

## Extra info

AssemblyScript isn't officially recognized by the GitHub Linguist yet, so its majority language (TypeScript) will likely show instead.
