## More info

[https://github.com/SNU-LoopG](https://github.com/SNU-LoopG)

This organization is used for the archival and development of the SNU LoopG package, SNUs place for posting Vine/TikTok style content.

## Extra notes

TikTok may be a bad example, sorry to Vine for this. What I mean by this is that the content type is of a short, looped format that is meant to loop over and over after 6-15 seconds. I have never used TikTok, so I am not entirely sure. This description is subject for change.
