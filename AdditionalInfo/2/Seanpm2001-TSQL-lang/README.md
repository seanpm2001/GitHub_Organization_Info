# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-TSQL-lang

## Description

For the archival and development of my projects written in the TSQL programming language, or containing TSQL source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-TSQL-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-TSQL-lang/)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in the TSQL (Transact-SQL (Structured Query Language)) programming language. The original rule was that TSQL had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any TSQL source code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

## Extra info

TSQL is the name of the language.

TSQL is a recognized language by GitHub.

TSQL stands for Transact-SQL, which in turn stands for Transact-Structured Query Language.

TSQL is a language by Microsoft. It is their own variant of SQL.

I am using a high quality (`800x800` pixels) logo for this project, but it is a bit blurry. It is the best I could get for now. It should be fine as an organization preview, as those are usually `200x200` pixels.

TSQL is not to be confused with SQL in general. I had to make a disclusion rule for this purpose, so some projects I planned to fork here today were not forked here.

<!--I don't know what TSQL-lang stands for, in the sense of programming languages. !-->
