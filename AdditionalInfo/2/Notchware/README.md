# GitHub organization: Notchware

## Description

The official GitHub organization for the archival and development of Notchware, and the definition of notchware.

## More info

[https://github.com/Notchware](https://github.com/Notchware/)

This project hosts the archival and development of my Notchware projects, along with the repository that holds the coined definition of Notchware.

## Extra info

This is a category project.

The logo for this project is a black square emoji, which resembles a notch pretty well.

This project contains 3 sub-projects:

- 1. [seanpm2001/Notchware](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Notchware/)

- 3. [seanpm2001/MalNotch](https://github.com/seanpm2001/MalNotch/)

Due to my inability to fork GitHub repositories outside of my own account at the moment, this organization is currently empty.

The homepage for this project is located [`here (seanpm2001/Notchware`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Notchware/)
