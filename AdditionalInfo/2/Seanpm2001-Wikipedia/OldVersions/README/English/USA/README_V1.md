# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-Wikipedia

## Description

The Seanpm2001 GitHub organization for Wikipedia related projects and forks.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Wikipedia](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Wikipedia/)

This project hosts the archival and development of projects and forks related to related to Wikipedia, its mission, and its projects.

## Extra info

This is a category project.

The logo for this project is in PNG format. It is an old Wikipedia logo. The SVG variant shown is the latest Wikipedia logo, as I couldn't find an SVG of the version 1 Wikipedia logo.

This projects scope is smaller than [Seanpm2001-WikiMedia](/AdditionalInfo/2/Seanpm2001-WikiMedia/) as this project only holds projects related to Wikipedia, and not Wiktionary, WikiBooks, Wikiversity, and the other WikiMedia/MediaWiki projects.

The logos were downloaded directly from [commons.wikimedia.org](https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?search=wikipedia+logo&title=Special:MediaSearch&go=Go&type=image)

Due to my inability to fork GitHub repositories outside of my own account at the moment, this organization is currently empty.

The homepage for this project is located [`here (unavailable, there is no current home repository for this project)`](https://www.example.com/)
