# GitHub organization: HT-Messenger

## Description

A specialized, encrypted messaging tool for use in Hospitals and medical centers.

## More info

[https://github.com/HT-Messenger](https://github.com/HT-Messenger/)

This organization is used for the archival and development of a new hospital messaging tool designed to be compliant with the hospital.

## Extra info

I forgot to take the Hippocratic oath today.

I made this project because I found an issue pointed out by my dad: he doesn't like how the hospital still has to use pagers to communicate, and although pagers are cool, they are really out of date, and need an upgrade. In order to make this work, the software has to be HIPAA compliant, which I feel will be easy.
