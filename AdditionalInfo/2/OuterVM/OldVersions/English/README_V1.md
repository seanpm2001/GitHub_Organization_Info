# GitHub organization: OuterVM

## Description

A collection of software and hardware tools targeted at providing functionality for a virtual machine from the outside.

## More info

[https://github.com/OuterVM](https://github.com/OuterVM/)

This organization is used for the archival, development, and showcasing of my software and hardware tool projects providing functionality for a virtual machine from outside the VM (on the host device)

## Extra info

As of 2021, Monday, October 25th at 4:30 pm, I currently have 1 project to fit this category, called OuterVM-Mouse. I originally was going to create an organization just for it, but I decided it would be better to have a suite of programs to do this.
