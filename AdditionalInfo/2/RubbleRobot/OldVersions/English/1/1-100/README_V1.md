For the development of the Rubble Robot disaster relief project.

## More info

This organization is used for the archival and development of my Rubble Robot project, a project intended to help with disaster relief when there is a ton of rubble.

## Extra info

This project is still early in development, and I don't have access to the hardware for it that costs over 40 million US dollars.
