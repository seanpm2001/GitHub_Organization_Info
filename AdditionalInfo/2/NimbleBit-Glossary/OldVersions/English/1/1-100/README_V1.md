A glossary of terms from the games and culture of the video game company NimbleBit.

## More info

[https://github.com/NimbleBit-Glossary](https://github.com/NimbleBit-Glossary/)

This organization is used for the archival and development of my reference article for culture and glossary terms of the various NimbleBit games and culture produced my the mobile video game company NimbleBit LLC.

## Extra info

This project is a very basic project. I considered just making a Gist, but why make a Gist when you can make a repository? A Gist doesn't have the functionality needed for this project.
