# GitHub organization: Wac-OS

## Description

The alternative GitHub organization for WacOS, the open source Apple replacement collection. See also: [@WacOS-dev](https://github.com/WacOS-dev/)

## More info

[https://github.com/Wac-OS](https://github.com/Wac-OS/)

This project hosts the archival and development of my megaproject, WacOS, an open source effort to recreate/imitate/emulate every Apple product and software piece. Originally just a Linux distribution for a MacOS/iOS environment on Linux, its scope expanded significantly.

## Extra info

This is not a category project.

This is a duplicate of [`@WacOS-dev`](/AdditionalInfo/2/WacOS-dev) with a different name. This is the closest I could get to `WacOS` without causing problems.

I could have chosen any logo for this project, I chose the WacOS aquatic W, because I was in a hurry. I might make a new logo for this project.

Due to my inability to fork GitHub repositories outside of my own account at the moment, this organization is currently empty.

The homepage for this project is located [`here (seanpm2001/WacOS`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/)
