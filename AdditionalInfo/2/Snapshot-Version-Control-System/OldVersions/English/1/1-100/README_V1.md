This organization is used for the archival and development of the Snapshot Version Control System (SCVS) which is a version control system I started developing in 2019 alongside SNU, with the main focus of snapshot archive files, an archive of every version of the file separately, and linked. It isn't the best system, it has become a habit for me, but it ensures that each days work remains static. It isn't much of a version control system, I wouldn't compare it to Git, and even if I did, Git is quintillions of times more advanced than creating a file with `_Snapshot1` or `_V3` at the end of it.

## Extra info

An icon of a camera shutter is used as a relation to the term snap (snapping/taking a picture) to the term snapshot.
