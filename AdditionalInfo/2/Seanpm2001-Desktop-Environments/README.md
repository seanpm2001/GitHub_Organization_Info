# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-Desktop-Environments

## Description

The Seanpm2001 GitHub organization for my Desktop Environment (DE) projects and forks.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Desktop-Environments](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Desktop-Environments/)

This project hosts the development and archival of projects that are Desktop Environments (DE) and/or core components of Desktop Environments.

## Extra info

This is a category project.

I am using a generic frame logo for this project that looks quite good, as I feel it fits better than the KDE logo, which was too large.

This category is for all my Desktop Environment (DE) projects and forks.

Example desktop environments:

EXPLORER.exe (Windows NT)

Aqua (Mac OS X)

TouchWiz (Samsung + Android)

GNOME (Linux)

KDE (Linux)

PIXEL (Raspberry Pi OS, Linux)

XFCE (Linux)

MATE (Linux)

Cinnamon (Linux)

Unity (Linux)

LXDE (Linux)

LXQT (Linux)

The homepage for this project is located [`here (unavailable, there is no current home repository for this project)`](https://www.example.com)
