## More info

[https://github.com/WakeNote](https://github.com/WakeNote/)

This project hosts archives and developments of the project WakeNote, an open source tool to hide notifications that may cause problems if seen first thing in the morning.

## Extra info

This project is still a work in progress.

The original description for the project goes as follows:

```
WakeNote is a tool that hides notifications from you until you confirm you want to read them, with technology to help prevent the reading of depressing messages first thing in the morning
```

It was not included in the main project, as it was too long, and got cut off.

The project icon is a bell, as a notification typically has a bell icon.
