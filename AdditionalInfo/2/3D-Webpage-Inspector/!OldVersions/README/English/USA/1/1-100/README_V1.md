# GitHub organization: 3D-Webpage-Inspector

## Description

The GitHub organization for the archival and development of my 3D Webpage Inspector browser addon.

## More info

[https://github.com/3D-Webpage-Inspector](https://github.com/3D-Webpage-Inspector/)

This project hosts the development and archival of the project `3D Webpage Inspector` which was inspired by a past Firefox feature of a similar name.

## Extra info

This is not a category project.

I am using a magnifying glass as the logo for this project. In the future, I would like to add some jumping 3D text behind it to better represent the project.

The project within this project is written in Rust, and is highly incomplete, and not functional yet.

<!--
As of 2022, May 27th, I don't have any projects that use for this organization yet.

Due to my inability to fork GitHub repositories outside of my own account at the moment, this organization is empty.

The homepage for this project is located [`here`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/3D-Webpage-Inspector)

There is no current home repository for this project.
