# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-1C-Enterprise-lang

## Description

For the archival and development of my projects written in the 1C Enterprise programming language, or containing 1C Enterprise source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-1C-Enterprise-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-1C-Enterprise-lang/)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in 1C-Enterprise. The original rule was that 1C-Enterprise had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any 1C-Enterprise code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

## Extra info

1C Enterprise is commonly known as one of the Cyrillic programming languages. It is commonly used to write software in Russian.
