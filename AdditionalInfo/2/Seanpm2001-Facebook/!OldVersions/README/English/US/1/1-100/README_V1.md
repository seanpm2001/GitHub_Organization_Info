# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-Facebook

## Description

The Seanpm2001 GitHub organization for the archival and development of Facebook projects and forks.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Facebook](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Facebook/)

This project hosts projects that are Facebook related projects and forks. They must either be by Facebook, or run on Facebook technologies.

## Extra info

This is a category project.

This is also a parent category project, and can include Instagram and WhatsApp projects as well, alongside Facebook.

The logo for this project is in JPEG format. This means that it is not transparent, but it doesn't have any white background problems, so it is fine

The logo in use uses weak/low effort skeuomorphism, I feel like it is fine to use, as I have lots of issues with Facebook, and it isn't something that should devote time to.

Facebook changed its name to Meta in 2022. I will NEVER recognize their name to be Meta, as it is far too generic, especially in the technology field.

Example for projects that fit here include forks of Facebook/Instagram/WhatsApp projects and archives, projects written in Hack/GraphQL/etc., projects that are related to Facebook/Instagram/WhatsApp (but not solely due to social media linkage) 

Despite the existance of this project, I still do not intend to use Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Facebook.other, but the technologies will be stashed here.

Due to issues with GitHub, this organization is currently empty, as I can't fork projects here at the moment.
