# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-DIGITAL-Command-Language

## Description

For the archival and development of my projects written in the DIGITAL Command Language programming language, or containing DIGITAL Command Language source code

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-DIGITAL-Command-Language-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-DIGITAL-Command-Language-lang/)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in the Graphviz (DOT) programming language. The original rule was that Graphviz (DOT) had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any Graphviz (DOT) source code is included.

## Extra info

DIGITAL Command Language is the name of the language.

DIGITAL Command Language is a recognized language by GitHub.

DIGITAL Command Language can be shortneed to DCL

DIGITAL Command Language is a language made by the historic (but now defunct) computer company known as DIGITAL Equipment Manufacturing

The logo currently in use is in GIF format, but is not animated.

I decided to use the logo for DIGITAL Equipment Manufacturing, as this language has no logo, and the DEC is so iconic, I wanted to use it here; also because it may be the only time I can use it in this sense.

The logo I am using is low quality (`200x200` pixels + GIF89 encoding) but it is the highest quality square version I can find.

The name of this language combined with the usual "shebang" I use was so long, that resulted in some things being shortened. I literally cannot add a `.` to the end of the [description](#Description), as I had exactly that amount of characters available minus 1.

<!--I don't know what DIGITAL-Command-Language stands for, in the sense of programming languages. !-->

No other extra info available.
