# GitHub organization: BootDown-dev

## Description

An experimental operating system project that runs at the BIOs level, but can be a functional operating system.

## More info

[https://github.com/BootDown-dev](https://github.com/BootDown-dev/)

This organization is used for the archival and development of a operating system project I thought of on 2021 September 19th, which is a concept for a bootloader that is as highly functional as possible without being an operating system, basically running directly from the hardware (similar to the BIOs/UEFI)

## Extra info

BootDown is an experimental operating system project that runs at the BIOs level, but can be a functional CLI or GUI operating system that can read and write files, access hard drives, and so on, before booting into the main operating system.

Severe limitations will be in place, such as a low file size limit, possibly pushing to partitions, and so on. I will need to research this concept more, this is an experimental project. Also, due to size reasons, multi-lingual support will be unavailable once you install. Each installation will only support 1 language.

Also, due to how basic the project is, don't expect to be able to do things like run a web browser, or use LibreOffice, but expect things like running Pong, Doom, or other games ported to Assembly, VHDL, Verilog, or SystemVerilog.

The project was originally called BL/S or BL/Ss (which stood for BootLoader System or BootLoader Subsystem) but the name was changed to BootDown, as the project is more than just a bootloader. BootDown is in reference to booting down to a lower level system, rather than booting up to a higher level system.

Multi-lingual support is currently unavailable, but the project is available in English. To install in a different language, you would have to download a different installation image in your preferred language, as this system is so small that it can only support 1 language at a time.

The boot from the scuba diver from the SpongeBob SquarePants movie (2004) seemed to fit this project well. I used a low resolution image, but this may not stay, as I want an original logo. I want something that resembles a dark and murky boot.
