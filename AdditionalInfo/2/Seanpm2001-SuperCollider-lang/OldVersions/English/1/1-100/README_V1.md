# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-SuperCollider-lang

## Description

For the development of my projects written in the SuperCollider language, or containing SuperCollider source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-SuperCollider-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-SuperCollider-lang)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in SuperCollider. The original rule was that SuperCollider had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any SuperCollider code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

## Extra info

Not to be confused with a particle accelerator/supercollider, this is a audio synthesis programming language.

I don't know if it is just me, but this image feels like an optical illusion. In some places where I upload it, part of it looks slanted, in other places, it looks like a normal block (like a Minecraft block) it especially looks normal in small previews.
