# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-Lex-lang

## Description

For the archival and development of my projects written in the Lex programming language, or containing Lex source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Lex-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Lex-lang/)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in Lex. The original rule was that Lex had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any Lex code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

## Extra info

I used a generic icon with the word Lex, as Lex doesn't have an obvious logo.
