# GitHub organization: GeniBlock

## Description

For the archival and development of GeniBlock, a software tool that blocks sexual content such as d*ck pics from being sent to you on various messaging clients.

## More info

[https://github.com/GeniBlock](https://github.com/GeniBlock/)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my project GeniBlock, a software tool designed to block unwanted sexual content (such as pictures of genitals or cleavage) from being sent to you on various platforms and messaging clients.

## Extra info

This project is written in Genie. Not all platforms support this language, so its use is a little limited. Software diversity must be supported though, so this stays.

GeniBlock is a portmanteau of Genital and Block.

This project has existed for several months, but an organization for it wasn't created until today (2021 November 22nd) there might be other projects out there as well.

This program is a Safe For Work (SFW) program, as it blocks Not Safe For Work (NSFW) content from being sent to you. Don't let the name make you think otherwise.

The name is pronounced both Genie Block, and Gen e Block. I don't mind if you pronounce it differently though, it shouldn't be something to get upset over.

When searching for projects written in Genie today, before creating [FreeGenie](/AdditionalInfo/2/FreeGenie-dev/README.md), I came across this project again. It was a lone project, so I created an organization for it.
