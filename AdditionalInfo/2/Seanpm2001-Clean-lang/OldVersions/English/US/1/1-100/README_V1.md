# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-Clean-lang

## Description

For the archival and development of my projects written in the Clean programming language, or containing Clean source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Clean-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Clean-lang/)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in the Clean language. The original rule was that Clean had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any Clean source code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

## Extra info

Clean is the name of the language. A good programming language should be clean, but it is fine if it is messy, as long as it is an organized mess.

The logo for this organization was modified from the SVG version of the 3.0 logo of the language.
