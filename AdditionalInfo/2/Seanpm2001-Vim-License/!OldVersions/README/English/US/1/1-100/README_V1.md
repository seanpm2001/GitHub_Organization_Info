# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-Vim-License

## Description

The Seanpm2001 GitHub organization for projects using the Vim license.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Vim-License](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Vim-License/)

This project is for archives and developments of my projects and forks of projects licensed under the Vim license.

## Extra info

This project uses an opaque pixel art version of the Vim logo. Despite being in PNG format, it has a white background. A modified transparent version is needed.

Since I can't fork projects at the moment, this organization is currently empty.

<!-- The home repository for this project, lies at [seanpm2001/Seanpm2001-Vim-License](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Seanpm2001-Vim-License/) !-->
