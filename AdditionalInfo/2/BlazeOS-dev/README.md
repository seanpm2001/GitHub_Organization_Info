## Description

For the archival and development of the BlazeOS operating system, a FLOSS alternative to Amazons FireOS software and other Amazon works.

## More info

[https://github.com/BlazeOS-dev](https://github.com/BlazeOS-dev)

This project hosts archives and development regarding the BlazeOS operating system project, a Free, Libre and Open Source Software (FLOSS) alternative to Amazons FireOS family of operating system, along with other Amazon software projects.

## Extra info

BlazeOS is named as it is, because Amazon names most of their works over antonyms and synonyms for fire, such as kindle and fireOS. I wanted to take the term Blaze before they can use it. As of now, I am relinquishing all copyright, trademark, and patent privileges from the use of the word `blaze` as simple words should not be used like this (Somehow, Amazon owns the word `fire`) There will be no legal issue if you name a project similarly, as long as you don't try to prevent others from using it.

This project is similar in scope to the WacOS project, as it aims to remake all of Amazon software, similarly to WacOS remaking better versions of Apple software.
