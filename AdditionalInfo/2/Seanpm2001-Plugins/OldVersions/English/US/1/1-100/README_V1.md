# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-Plugins

## Description

The Seanpm2001 GitHub organization for software plugin projects.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Plugins](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Plugins/)

This project hosts archives and developments of my projects in the field of Plugins and Plugins software, a very niche platform.

## Extra info

This project is for browser and program Plugins. It is not to be confused with [Seanpm2001-Addons](/AdditionalInfo/2/Seanpm2001-Addons/)

I chose a basic plugin logo for this project, I couldn't find very many good results for this category.

This organization is currently empty, as I am unable to fork projects at the moment.
