This organization is used for the archival and development of my video game project, **The Pirates (copy)** (the copy portion of the name is in reference to file duplication, but can also mean that "pirates" copy files) the game is meant to challenge the term "piracy" in regards to digital downloading (as downloading a file is much less severe than boarding a ship and brutally mutilating its entire crew, and stealing all their belongings, the 2 terms should be completely separated) 

## Extra info

The game was not too well received by 1 family member, but I really liked the concept and story, and went with it. The game also questions copyright, and is written in GDScript, Python, and Rust. It is my first game to use the free and open source GoDot game engine. It was pretty good practice for learning the language, which is incredibly similar to Python in terms of syntax, which made it a lot easier to learn.
