# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-E-lang

## Description

For the archival and development of my projects written in the E programming language, or containing E source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-E-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-E-lang/)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in E. The original rule was that E had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any E code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

## Extra info

I discovered this language via GitHub, as sometimes, my Eiffel files would be misidentified/incorrectly programmed.

E doesn't have an official logo, so I used the best alternative I could find.
