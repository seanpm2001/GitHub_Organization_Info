# GitHub organization: SNU-Update-Log

## Description

Home of the SNU update log, a log of SNUs update history. 2D mode (original): https://github.com/seanpm2001/SNU_2D_UpdateLog/

## More info

[https://github.com/SNU-Update-Log](https://github.com/SNU-Update-Log/)

This project hosts archives and developments of the SNU Update log project, the place on SNU where updates are logged and documented. The other half is at the [developer log](/AdditionalInfo/2/SNU-Developer-Log/)

## Extra info

The SNU Update Log is a documentation project.

This project is written mostly in HTML5 and Rich Text Format.

This project currently uses the original SNU update log logo from the project as the organization logo. This image was made in GIMP.

I originally forgot to create an organization for this project, as I seem to have overlooked it originally.

The home repository for this project lies at [seanpm2001/SNU-2D_UpdateLog](https://github.com/seanpm2001/SNU_2D_UpdateLog/)
