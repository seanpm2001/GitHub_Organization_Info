# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-DTrace-lang

## Description

For the archival and development of my projects written in the DTrace programming language, or containing DTrace source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-DTrace-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-DTrace-lang/)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in the DTrace programming language. The original rule was that DTrace had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any DTrace source code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

## Extra info

DTrace is the name of the language.

The logo I am using is a low resolution thumbnail of an old style Kindle book preview for a book on the DTrace language. It was the closest thing I could find, and I found it unique.

DTrace is a recognized language by GitHub, as of 2022 February 25th.

<!--The logo currently in use is in GIF format, but is not animated. !-->

<!--I don't know what DTrace stands for, in the sense of programming languages. !-->

No other extra info available.
