# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-Ukraine

## Description

The Seanpm2001 GitHub organization for projects with Ukraine themes/strong associations.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Ukraine](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Ukraine/)

This project hosts the archival and development of projects and forks that are strongly related to the United States of America (strong associations and or themes)

## Extra info

This is a country category project.

The logo for this project is the GitHub Ukraine Flag emoji `üá∫üá¶Ô∏è`. It is really low quality (64x64) and will need a higher quality replacement in the future. I considered just making a higher quality version, but I wanted to stick with the Emoji and quality level theme I started.

The SVG version was created with Inkscape. I am not very good with Inkscape yet, I merely imported the binary file into the vector editor, and had it convert it to SVG. Due to this, it is still the same quality level, and looks blurry when zooming. It is also not a W3C valid SVG, and takes up more space than the PNG version. Any suggestions on how I can do a better job using Inkscape are welcome.

I included this country in this list, as it is an area interest of interest, and I have some projects that have strong themes here, including:

- 1. [seanpm2001/Ukraine](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Ukraine)
- 2. [seanpm2001/Awesome-Ukrainian-Software](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Awesome-Ukrainian-Software/)
- 3. [seanpm2001/Ukraine-History-Simulator](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Ukraine-History-Simulator)

Due to my inability to fork GitHub repositories outside of my own account at the moment, this organization is currently empty.

The homepage for this project is located [`here (seanpm2001/Ukraine)`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Ukraine/)
