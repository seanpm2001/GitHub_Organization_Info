# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-LOLCODE-lang

## Description

For the archival and development of my projects written in the LOLCODE programming language, or containing LOLCODE source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-LOLCODE-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-LOLCODE-lang/)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in LOLCODE. The original rule was that LOLCODE had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any LOLCODE code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

## Extra info

LOLCODE is a language that imitates the speech of the LOLCAT meme. LOLCODE is frequently criticized for not being very esoteric, but rather being an ordinary procedural language with an unusual vocabulary.
