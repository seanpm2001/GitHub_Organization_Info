# GitHub organization: Phoneticut

## Description

Phoneticut is a voice actor replacement: Make a certain amount of sounds, and have stitching and deepfakes do the rest.

## More info

[https://github.com/Phoneticut](https://github.com/Phoneticut/)

This project hosts archives and developments of the project Phoneticut, a voice acting software that uses deepfakes to generate a voice profile for voice actors, letting them live without having to do the voice acting work.

## Extra info

This projects idea was not rushed, but development was sporadic. I first tried to write it in CSound, found it impossible, went to Perl, but didn't have the time to figure out Perl, so I defaulted to Python.

This project is written in Python.

This projects name is a portmanteau of Phonetic and cut.

This project currently uses a generic microphone as its logo.

The home repository for this project lies at [seanpm2001/Phoneticut](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Phoneticut/)

This project was originally private in its early developments, but was made public on 2022, Friday, April 8th after officially launching its parent organization.
