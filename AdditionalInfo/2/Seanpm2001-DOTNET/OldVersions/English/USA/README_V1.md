# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-DOTNET

## Description

The Seanpm2001 GitHub organization for my Microsoft .NET related projects and forks.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-DOTNET](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-DOTNET/)

This project hosts the development and archival of projects and forks in relation to the DOTNET platform.

## Extra info

This is a category project.

I am using the old version of the .NET logo for this project, as it looks better to me.

This category is for all my .NET related projects. They have to be written in 1 or more of the following languages:

- [ ] ASP.NET
- [ ] C#
- [ ] F#
- [ ] IronPython
- [ ] IronRuby
- [ ] JScript.NET
- [ ] Q#
- [ ] VB.NET
- [ ] Other languages that fit this category, but are not listed

<!--
As of 2022, May 27th, I don't have any projects that use for this organization yet.
!-->

Due to my inability to fork GitHub repositories outside of my own account at the moment, this organization is empty.

There is no current home repository for this project.
