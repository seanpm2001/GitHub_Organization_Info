# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-Oracle

## Description

The Seanpm2001 GitHub organization for Oracle related projects and forks.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Oracle](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Oracle/)

This project hosts the development and archival of projects and forks related to Oracle, and other Oracle software projects.

## Extra info

This is a category project.

I could not find a glossy/3D oracle logo for this project, so I am using one with a red background and white text.

VirtualBox-related projects are allowed here under strict conditions (they must be heavily reliant on Oracle)

<!--
As of 2022, May 27th, I don't have any projects that use for this organization yet.
!-->

Due to my inability to fork GitHub repositories outside of my own account at the moment, this organization is empty.

The homepage for this project is located [`here (unavailable, there is no current home repository for this project)`](https://www.example.com)
