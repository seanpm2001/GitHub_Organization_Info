# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-GCC-Machine-Description-lang

## Description

For the archival and development of my projects written in th GCC Machine Desc. lang programming language, or containing GCC Machine Desc. lang source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-GCC-Machine-Description-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-GCC-Machine-Description-lang/)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in the GCC-Machine-Description-lang programming language. The original rule was that GCC-Machine-Description-lang had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any GCC-Machine-Description-lang source code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

## Extra info

This language name is so long, that I am surprised it actually let me name it uncut. I did have to shorten the description however (`description` had to be changed to `desc.`)

**GCC** stands for **G**NU **C**ompiler **C**ollection.

<!-- The current logo in use is in png format. This means that it is transparent. This image does not have any issues with background color. !-->

<!-- The current logo in use is in JPEG format. This means that it is not transparent, but it needs a replacement without a solid white background. !-->

<!-- GCC-Machine-Description-lang programs have the `.sql` file extension, which is the same for most SQL implementations and variations. !-->

I currently cannot figure out what file extension GCC Machine Description language programs use.

The logo currently in use is in GIF format, but is not animated. It is also very low quality (100x100)

<!-- I don't know what GCC-Machine-Description-lang-lang stands for, in the sense of programming languages. !-->

No other extra info available.
