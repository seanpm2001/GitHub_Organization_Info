# GitHub organization: MEDOS-HDD

## Description

The GitHub organization for MEDOS HDD, the Hard Disk Drive variant of the MEDOS operating system. Part of the Meadows operating system project.

## More info

[https://github.com/MEDOS-HDD](https://github.com/MEDOS-HDD/)

This project hosts the archival and development of the MEDOS subproject, MEDOS HDD, a variant of MEDOS meant to be run directly off a Hard Disk Drive (HDD)

## Extra info

This is not a category project.

The logo for this project is a (internal) hard drive icon with the dark green `MEDOS` wordmark above it, and the text:

- Hard Disk Drive

Below the HDD disk in a stone texture, with the text:

- Operating System

Below the stone text, in the same dark green pattern used for the `MEDOS` wordmark. I hope to get a version with an external drive, rather than an internal one.

This is an unidentified tier storage device that MEDOS can operate on. The next level up is [`MEDOS SSD`](/AdditionalInfo/2/MEDOS-SSD/)

Due to my inability to fork GitHub repositories outside of my own account at the moment, this organization is currently empty.

The homepage for this project is located [`here (seanpm2001/MEDOS-HDD`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/MEDOS-HDD/)
