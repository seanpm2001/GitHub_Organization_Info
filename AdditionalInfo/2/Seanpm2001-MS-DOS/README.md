# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-MS-DOS

## Description

The Seanpm2001 GitHub organization for my MS-DOS/PC-DOS related projects and forks.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-MS-DOS](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-MS-DOS/)

This project hosts projects that are MS-DOS related projects and forks. They must either be by MS-DOS (MicroSoft Disk Operating System) or run on MS-DOS technologies. PC-DOS (Personal Computer Disk Operating System) forks and technological projects are allowed as well.


## Extra info

This is a category project.

The logo for this project is in JPEG format. This means that it is not transparent. I hope to get a version without a white background in the future.

Due to issues with GitHub, this organization is currently empty, as I can't fork projects here at the moment.
