# GitHub organization: SNU-Lobby

## Description

For the archival and development of the SNU Lobby.

## More info

[https://github.com/SNU-Lobby](https://github.com/SNU-Lobby/)

This project hosts the development and archival of the SNU Lobby project, the lobby page for SNU.

## Extra info

This is not a category project.

I am using the current default SNU logo placeholder for this project, as I haven't designed a custom logo for this project yet.

I recently remembered that I forgot to list this project. There may be some other SNU projects I still havem't gotten to.
