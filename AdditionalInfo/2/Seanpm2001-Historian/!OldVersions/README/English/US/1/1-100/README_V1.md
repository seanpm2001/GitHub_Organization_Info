# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-Historian

## Description

The Seanpm2001 GitHub organization for historical projects, but NOT for search history projects.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Historian](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Historian/)

This project hosts archives and developments of my projects related to the field of history.

## Extra info

This is a category project.

The logo of this project is a Windows 9x icon of a globe. Previously, it was categorized as an unused graphic, but I feel it works well here.

This project is not to be confused with [Seanpm2001-history](/AdditionalInfo/2/Seanpm2001-History/) which is coming a week after writing this (2022, Friday, April 29th) the other project (Seanpm2001-History) covers:

* The history of Seanpm2001

* Search history projects

* But not Seanpm2001 life archive projects
