This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in the WDL programming language. The original rule was that WDL had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any WDL source code is included.

## Extra info

WDL is the name of the language

WDL is a recognized language by GitHub.

WDL stands for `Workflow Description Language`

The current logo in use is in PNG format. It is not transparent, and it does need background color fixes. I am using the official logo, which has no transparency.

WDL programs have the `.wdl` file extension.

The official GitHub organization for WDL is located at [openwdl/](https://github.com/openwdl/)

<!--I don't know what CommonWorkflowLanguage-lang stands for, in the sense of programming languages. !-->
