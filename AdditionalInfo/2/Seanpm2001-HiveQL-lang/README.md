# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-HiveQL-lang

## Description

For the archival and development of my projects written in the HiveQL programming language, or containing HiveQL source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-HiveQL-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-HiveQL-lang/)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in the HiveQL programming language. The original rule was that HiveQL had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any HiveQL source code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)
