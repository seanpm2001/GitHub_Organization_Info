# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-VSmell-lang

## Description

For the development of my projects written in the VSmell language, or containing VSmell source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-VSmell-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-VSmell-lang/)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in VSmell. The original rule was that VSmell had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any VSmell code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

## Extra info

This language is still in incredibly early development and is far from ready to even do anything other than look pretty and serve as a concept.
