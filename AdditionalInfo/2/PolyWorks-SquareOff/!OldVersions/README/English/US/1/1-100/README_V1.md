# GitHub organization: PolyWorks-SquareOff

## Description

 A technology framework for image properties with more than 2/3 values (expanding past XYZ) 

## More info

[https://github.com/PolyWorks-SquareOff](https://github.com/PolyWorks-SquareOff/)

This project hosts archives and developments of the project PolyWorks: SquareOff, a software library project for showing image properties of a non 2D/3D image, or an image with dimensions past the default, such as 1920x1080

## Extra info

This project is still very early in development, and it was a bit rushed. I intend to fix this. It was brewed a while back, and was published through my new idea = publish strategy.

A Tesseract (4D Cube/square) is used as the logo for this project.

I named this project SquareOff, as it is a library for images that don't have square dimensions, and can contain massive amounts of axis points.

The home repository for this project lies at [seanpm2001/PolyWorks-SquareOff](https://github.com/seanpm2001/PolyWorks-SquareOff/)

This project was originally private in its early developments, but was made public on 2022, Friday, April 8th after officially launching its parent organization.
