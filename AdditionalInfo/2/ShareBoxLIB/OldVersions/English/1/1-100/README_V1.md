# GitHub organization: ShareBoxLIB

## Description

For the archival and development of the sharebox sharing library.

## More info

[https://github.com/ShareBoxLIB](https://github.com/ShareBoxLIB/)

This project hosts the archival and development of my software library program known as ShareBox, which is a highly advanced and configurable content sharing dialog menu for social media platforms and other websites.

## Extra info

This project uses 2 icons. I couldn't use the original, as GitHub has a 1 MiB (1,048,576 bytes) limit for profile pictures, and the original image is over 2 MiB. The version I used is a screenshot, cropped version that contains no transparency, and contains the PNG checker texture instead. You can use the dropdowns to show/hide the preferred one. The high resolution version is hidden by default.

This project is still very early in development, it has been in planning for a couple weeks now.
