# GitHub organization: WacWrite

## Description

The GitHub organization for WacWrite, an open source alternative to MacWrite. Part of the WacOS operating system project.

## More info

[https://github.com/WacWrite](https://github.com/WacWrite/)

This project hosts the archival and development of the WacOS subproject, WacWrite, which is an open source alternative and recreation of MacWrite.

## Extra info

This is not a category project.

I used the original MacWrite logo for this project, which was only 32 by 32 pixels. I zoomed it in to 512x512, then added a blue texture to it. I could have left it blank, but I kind of like it this way. It also reminds me of my high school mascot (WA-HI Blue devils) a bit. It also distracts from the low quality zoom I did.

Due to my inability to fork GitHub repositories outside of my own account at the moment, this organization is currently empty.

The homepage for this project is located [`here (seanpm2001/WacWrite`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacWrite/)
