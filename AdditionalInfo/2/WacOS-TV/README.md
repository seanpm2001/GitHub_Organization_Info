# GitHub organization: WacOS-TV

## Description

The GitHub organization for WacTVOS, an open source alternative to Apples tvOS. Part of the WacOS operating system project. See also: @WacTVOS

## More info

[https://github.com/WacOS-TV](https://github.com/WacOS-TV/)

This project hosts the archival and development of my project, WacOS-TV, which is a subsystem of the WacOS project that aims to imitate/recreate the various versions of Apples tvOS. It is currently very early in development, and is not functional yet.

## Extra info

This is not a category project.

This is a duplicate of [`@WacTVOS`](/AdditionalInfo/2/WacTVOS/) with a different name.

The logo for this project is a custom logo, consisting of the `WacOS-TV` logomark across a gr√¶y paper wallpaper.
