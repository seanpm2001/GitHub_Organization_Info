## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-SourcePawn-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-SourcePawn-lang/)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in SourcePawn. The original rule was that SourcePawn had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any SourcePawn code is included.
