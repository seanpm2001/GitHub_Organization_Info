# GitHub organization: OpenGS-OS

## Description

The GitHub organization for OpenGS/OS, an open source remake of Apple GS/OS. Part of the WacOS operating system project. A mirror of @WacOS-OpenGS

## More info

[https://github.com/OpenGS-OS](https://github.com/OpenGS-OS/)

This project hosts the archival and development of my project, WacOS/OpenGS, which is a subsystem of the WacOS project that aims to imitate/recreate the GS/OS operating system. It is currently very early in development, and is not functional yet.

## Extra info

This is not a category project.

This is a duplicate of [`@WacOS-OpenGS`](/AdditionalInfo/2/WacOS-OpenGS/) with a different name.

The logo for this project is a custom logo, consisting of the top text: `OpenGS` and the bottom text (larger than the top text, and centered): `OS` it uses a line pattern to appear graphically similar to its predecessor.

Due to my inability to fork GitHub repositories outside of my own account at the moment, this organization is currently empty.

The homepage for this project is located [`here (seanpm2001/WacOS_OpenGS`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS_OpenGS/)
