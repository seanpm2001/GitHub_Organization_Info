# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-Io-lang

## Description

For the archival and development of my projects written in the Io programming language, or containing Io source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Io-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Io-lang/)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in the Io programming language. The original rule was that Io had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any Io source code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

## Extra info

Io is the name of the language.

Io is a recognized language by GitHub.

I couldn't find a logo for this language, so I am using a generic wordmark with the text `io`

Io is not to be confused with lo (i o vs. l o) it is very hard to tell the difference with most fonts, due to the similarity with i, l, and 1 (one)

<!-- The current logo in use is in JPEG format. This means that it is not transparent, but it needs a replacement without a solid white background. !-->

Io programs have the `.io` file extension.

<!-- I currently cannot figure out what file extension Io programs use. !-->

<!-- The logo currently in use is in GIF format, but is not animated.!-->

<!--I don't know what Io-lang stands for, in the sense of programming languages. !-->

No other extra info available.
