This organization is used for the archival and development of the game and concept known as hyper realistic farming simulator, which is a farming game that aims to be so realistic and similar to real life that it will be boring (crops won't take 2 minutes to grow, but will take over 90 real days to grow, environmental factors will be included, and it won't be easy) it is designed to be realistic and possibly boring, and may just remain a concept if there isn't enough interest.
