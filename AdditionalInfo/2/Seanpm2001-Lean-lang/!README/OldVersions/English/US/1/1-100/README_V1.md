This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in the Lean programming language. The original rule was that Lean had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any Lean source code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

## Extra info

Lean is the name of the language

Lean is a recognized language by GitHub.

Lean is a theorem prover language for mathematics.

The current logo in use is in PNG format. This means that it is transparent, but it does not need background color replacement. I am using a generic logo, as Lean doesn't appear to have its own logo.

Lean programs have the `.lean` file extension.

The official GitHub organization for Lean is located at [Leanprover](https://github.com/leanprover/)

> Link to the home repository (Languages: C++, Lean, CMake, C, Shell, Python, Other) [leanprover/Lean](https://github.com/leanprover/lean/)

<!-- I currently cannot figure out what file extension Lean programs use. !-->

<!-- The logo currently in use is in GIF format, but is not animated.!-->

<!--I don't know what Lean-lang stands for, in the sense of programming languages. !-->

No other extra info is currently available.
