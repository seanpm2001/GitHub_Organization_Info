For the archival and development of my projects written in the Metal programming language, or containing Metal source code.

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Metal-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Metal-lang/)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in Metal. The original rule was that Metal had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any Metal code is included.
