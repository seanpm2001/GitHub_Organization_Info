# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-XProc-lang

## Description

For the archival and development of my projects written in the XProc programming language, or containing XProc source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-XProc-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-XProc-lang/)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in the XProc programming language. The original rule was that XProc had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any XProc source code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

## Extra info

XProc is the name of the language.

XProc is a recognized language by GitHub.

The current logo in use is in PNG format. This means that it is transparent. It is not in a perfect square, so it had to be cropped a little for the organization picture.

XProc programs use the `.xpl` file extension.

<!-- I currently cannot figure out what file extension XProc programs use. !-->

<!-- The logo currently in use is in GIF format, but is not animated.!-->

I don't know what XProc-lang stands for, in the sense of programming languages.

No other extra info available.
