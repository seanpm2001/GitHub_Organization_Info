# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-PostGreSQL-lang

## Description

For the archival and development of my projects written in the PostGreSQL programming language, or containing PostGreSQL source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-PostGreSQL-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-PostGreSQL-lang/)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in the PostGreSQL programming language. The original rule was that PostGreSQL had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any PostGreSQL source code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

## Extra info

I made a mistake when naming this. PostGreSQL might have been recognized as a language on its own by GitHub in the past, but the closest I can find now is [PLpgSQL](/AdditionalInfo/2/Seanpm2001-PLpgSQL-lang/). I still kept going with it, just in case. This is also why the organization title uses `"language"` instead of `language`

The current logo in use is in png format. This means that it is transparent. This image does not have any issues with background color.

Both the PostGreSQL and PLpgSQL organizations use the PostGreSQL logo, however, this organization uses a lower quality (205x205) logo with a wordmark, while the other uses a higher quality (2400x2400) logo without a wordmark.

<!-- The current logo in use is in JPEG format. This means that it is not transparent, but it needs a replacement without a solid white background. !-->

<!-- PostGreSQL programs have the `.moon` file extension. !-->

<!-- I currently cannot figure out what file extension PostGreSQL programs use. !-->

File extension info is unavailable for this entry.

<!-- The logo currently in use is in GIF format, but is not animated.!-->

<!--I don't know what PostGreSQL-lang stands for, in the sense of programming languages. !-->

No other extra info available.
