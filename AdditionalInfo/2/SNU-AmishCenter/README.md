## More info

[https://github.com/SNU-AmishCenter](https://github.com/SNU-AmishCenter)

This organization is used for the archival and development of the SNU Amish Center package, SNUs built-in joke page about the Amish people, what they are, and why you can't both be Amish and an Internet user. This package contains built-in jokes, a survey that tells you that you aren't Amish, and more. It is to be used as a reference when someone mentions the term `"Amish"` on the site.

## Extra notes

1 copyrighted video was embedded into this projects main page, which is the song `Amish Paradise` by music artist `"Weird" Al Yankovic` I can't provide it due to copyright reasons, but it is possible to obtain a copy.

"Captain obvious here again, the joke here is that Amish people believe in the old fashioned way of life and renounce all electronics. This includes the Internet. The Amish don't use anything that uses electricity, and thus do not use the Internet, as they don't use technology. Most Amish people still live on rural farms and some don't use any tools." - Captain obvious (expert in explaining the obvious)
