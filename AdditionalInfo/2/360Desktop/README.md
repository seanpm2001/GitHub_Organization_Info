# GitHub organization: 360Desktop

## Description

The home GitHub organization for the archival and development of the 360 desktop project: [https://github.com/seanpm2001/360Desktop](https://github.com/seanpm2001/360Desktop/)

## More info

[https://github.com/360Desktop](https://github.com/360Desktop/)

This project hosts the archival and development of the 360 desktop project, a desktop extension that allows 360Â° technologies on the Linux desktop.

## Extra info

This is a normal project.

Support for Windows, MacOS, BSD, and other operating systems is coming soon.

This project is very early in development, and is not functional yet. It needs more backers and developers.

The logo for this project is in PNG format. It is not transparent, and is not an exact square. It needs a new version that is cropped/stretched, and has a transparent background.

Due to issues with GitHub, this organization is currently empty, as I can't fork projects here at the moment.

The homepage for this project is located [`here`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/360Desktop/).
