# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-J-lang

## Description

For the development of my projects written in the J language, or containing J source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-J-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-J-lang)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in J. The original rule was that J had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any J code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

## Extra info

Not to be confused with Objective-J or JScript.
