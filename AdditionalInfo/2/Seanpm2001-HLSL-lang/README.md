# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-HLSL-lang

## Description

For the archival and development of my projects written in the HLSL programming language, or containing HLSL source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-HLSL-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-HLSL-lang/)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in HLSL. The original rule was that HLSL had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any HLSL code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

## Extra info

HLSL stands for High Level Shading Language.

This project uses a generic logo. I don't know if HLSL has an official one or not.
