# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-StandardML-lang

## Description

For the archival and development of my projects written in the Standard ML programming language, or containing Standard ML source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-StandardML-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-StandardML-lang/)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in the Standard ML language. The original rule was that Standard ML had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any Standard ML source code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

## Extra info

Standard ML is the name of the language. I can't find an official logo for Standard ML, so I chose the closest one I could find.

ML commonly stands for "Machine Learning" but this language has a different acronym meaning, although I can't find it.

I don't know what differentiates `Standard ML` from other ML variants.

My ML megacategory is at [`Seanpm2001-ML-lang`](/AdditionalInfo/2/Seanpm2001-ML-lang/). It includes all variants of ML, including `Standard ML` `OCAML` `etc ML` etc. Its reason as a category is because it is for the ML family of languages.
