This project hosts archives and developments of the project IsraeLinux, an open source media Linux distribution designed for use 

## Extra info

Disclaimer: I am not Jewish, I just thought this would be a good idea, and I already had the pun. We don't have a TempleOS like system for Linux, this is a start.

This distribution is a media-based Linux distribution similar to Ubuntu Satanic Edition or Hannah Montana Linux, in which not much gets added feature wise, it is mostly themed and distributed with programs designed for a specific purpose.

The alternative name for this project is JerusaLinux.

I found out after creating this project that the current flag of Israel is a bit controversial. I am not sure where to go on this right now.
