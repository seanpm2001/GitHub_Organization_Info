# GitHub organization: ScreenTeX

## Description

ScreenTeX is a tool that grabs all text when taking a screenshot rather than getting an image

## More info

[https://github.com/ScreenTeX](https://github.com/ScreenTeX/)

This organization is used for the archival and development of a software project I thought of on 2021 September 19th about a screenshot tool that can grab just the text on the screen instead of an image.

## Extra info

Despite TeX being in the name, the project is not written in TeX. Exporting text into TeX format is possible though, and is a planned feature.

An option to save the text and the screenshot at the same time is also coming soon, and will supercede the `ALT` + `P` + `F10` shortcut.

The project does not use a special algorithm to read the image and export the text, it just copies everything from the background and puts it into a file. If this is not possible in some cases due to DRM or other system failures, you will likely just need to stop using that software/website, wait for your computer to become stable again, or fix your computer. In the meantime, you can always get a picture with a separate camera if you have one, although it will be of lower quality and hard to make out (and won't copy the text)
