# GitHub organization: LightSpeedRelayTechnologies

## Description

Lightspeed Relay is a set of technologies for data transfer between vast distances at/near the speed of light, one planet to the next.

## More info

[https://github.com/LightSpeedRelayTechnologies](https://github.com/LightSpeedRelayTechnologies/)

This project hosts my technology set for intergalactic/very, very long range data transfers. Its purpose is to define and assist the concept and process of taking data from 1 planet/space object and communicating with another from 0.2 light seconds or longer away. For example, a communication between Geneva, Switzerland(üá®üá≠Ô∏è) and the middle of Earths moon would take about 1.3 seconds if the data was traveling at the speed of light.

## Extra info

The icon is of a spaceship right now. I hope to change it in the future to something that resembles the project better.

The projects in this set are written in Python and SQL. Python is for the application frameworks, and SQL is for the databases.

Contrary to its name, a lightyear isn't a unit of time, it is a unit of measurement.

Currently, data can't travel at the speed of light, but it comes pretty close, traveling at about ~1,078,260,500 Kilometers per hour (~17,971,008.3333 kilometers per second)
