# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-Legal

## Description

The Seanpm2001 GitHub organization for law related projects and forks.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Legal](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Legal/)

This project hosts the development and archival of projects and forks related to the rule of law, and its involvement in software development.

## Extra info

This is a category project.

I am using a detailed scale icon for this organization, as that is usually what law is recognized with.

All projects here are legal under the law of the source country (United States) that isn't what this organization is for though.

Example projects include the [SNU Legal Resource Center](https://github.com/seanpm2001/SNU_LegalResourceCenter/)

<!--
As of 2022, May 27th, I don't have any projects that use for this organization yet.

Due to my inability to fork GitHub repositories outside of my own account at the moment, this organization is empty.

The homepage for this project is located [`here (unavailable, there is no current home repository for this project)`](https://www.example.com/)
