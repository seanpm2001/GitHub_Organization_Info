# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-Engines

## Description

The Seanpm2001 GitHub organization for software engine projects.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Engines](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Engines/)

This project is for archives and developments of my projects and forks of software engine projects.

## Extra info

This project uses an icon with 2 gears in a box. I was hoping a detailed engine icon existed, but I couldn't find one.

This project is NOT for search engines. It is for other software engines. An example would be GoDot.

Search engine projects can be found at [Seanpm2001-SearchEngines](/AdditionalInfo/2/Seanpm2001-SearchEngines/)

Since I can't fork projects at the moment, this organization is currently empty.

<!-- The home repository for this project, lies at [seanpm2001/Seanpm2001-Engines](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Seanpm2001-Engines/) !-->
