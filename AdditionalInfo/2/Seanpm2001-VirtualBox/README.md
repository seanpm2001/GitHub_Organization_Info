# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-VirtualBox

## Description

The Seanpm2001 GitHub organization for software and media projects related to Oracle VM VirtualBox (previously: SunMicroystems VirtualBox)

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-VirtualBox](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-VirtualBox/)

This project hosts projects that are related to VirtualBox, or work directly with VirtualBox. Hopefully, someday, VirtualBox source code will be capable of being forked here.

## Extra info

This is a category project.

This is a subcategory of the Oracle category.

The logo for this project is the Oracle VM VirtualBox in the resolution `512x512` I hope to get an SVG version separately in the future.

Due to issues with GitHub, this organization is currently empty, as I can't fork projects here at the moment.
