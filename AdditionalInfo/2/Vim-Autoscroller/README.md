# GitHub organization: Vim-Autoscroller

## Description

The GitHub organization for the archival and development of Vim Autoscroller.

## More info

[https://github.com/Vim-Autoscroller](https://github.com/Vim-Autoscroller/)

This project hosts the development and archival of projects and forks of my Vim addon, Vim Autoscroller.

## Extra info

This is not a category project.

I am using an unofficial Vim logo for this project, as I ran out of original Vim logos to use for organizations.

<!--
As of 2022, May 27th, I don't have any projects that use for this organization yet.

Due to my inability to fork GitHub repositories outside of my own account at the moment, this organization is empty.

The homepage for this project is located [`here`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Vim-Autoscroller/)
