# GitHub organization: TrueEEG

## Description

The GitHub organization for a renewed EEG (Electroencephalography) software toolkit to help keep hospitals secure and up to date.

## More info

[https://github.com/TrueEEG](https://github.com/TrueEEG/)

This organization is used for the archival and development of a new EEG machine software set, as the current ones used in hospitals can only be run on Windows XP and lower, and hasn't received any updates in 16 years. I hope to spread open source to hospitals, and give them much better maintained software, and security.

## Extra info

I forgot to take the Hippocratic oath today.

EEG stands for Electroencephalography which is a method of brain scanning (for things like incomplete/missing lobes, braindeath, etc.)
