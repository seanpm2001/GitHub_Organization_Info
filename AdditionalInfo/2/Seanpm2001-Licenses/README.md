# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-Licenses

## Description

The Seanpm2001 GitHub organization for projects and forks related to software licensing.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Licenses](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Licenses/)

This project hosts the development and archival of projects and forks related to software licensing.

## Extra info

This is a category project.

I am using a certificate icon, as it is close as I could get to a general license icon.

This project is for projects about software licensing. Since all my projects contain a software license, they won't all be added here, as that would be too broad.

Example projects include the [Slick License Manager](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Slick-LM/)

<!--
As of 2022, May 27th, I don't have any projects that use for this organization yet.
!-->

Due to my inability to fork GitHub repositories outside of my own account at the moment, this organization is empty.

The homepage for this project is located [`here (unavailable, there is no current home repository for this project)`](https://www.example.com/)
