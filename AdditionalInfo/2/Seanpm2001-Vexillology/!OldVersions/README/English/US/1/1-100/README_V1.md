# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-Vexillology

## Description

The Seanpm2001 GitHub organization for vexillology (flags & the study of flags) projects.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Vexillology](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Vexillology/)

This project hosts archives and developments of my projects related to the field of Vexillology (flags and the study of flags)

## Extra info

This is a category project.

I am using a generic logo of the globe with many flags. I feel it is appropriate to list as many flags as possible in the logo.

The current logo unfortunately does not appear to show the üá∫üá¶Ô∏è Ukrainian flag.

The Firefox profile used to develop this uses a theme with the üá≥üáµÔ∏èflag of Nepal. This was done, as I have had heavy mentions of Ukraine recently, and needed to shed light on other flags. I chose Nepal's flag for this example, as it is the only non-rectangular state flag in the world at the moment.
