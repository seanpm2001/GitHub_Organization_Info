# GitHub organization: Its-time-to-cut-WideVine-DRM

## Description

A place for my DeGoogle article on getting rid of WideVine DRM and DRM in general. Lets cut the WideVine and embrace an open Internet.

## More info

[https://github.com/Its-time-to-cut-WideVine-DRM](https://github.com/Its-time-to-cut-WideVine-DRM/)

This organization is used for the archival and development of my most popular DeGoogle article (as of 2021 Sunday September 12th) which talks about Googles WideVine DRM.

## Extra info

A Raster (PNG) version of the DRM Free protest sticker is used, instead of the commonly used Vector (SVG) version. This is done due to GitHub limitations with SVG files (only PNG, JPG/JPEG, and GIF are allowed for profile photos and social previes)
