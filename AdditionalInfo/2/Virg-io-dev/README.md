# GitHub organization: Virg-io-dev

## Description

For the development of the possibly NSFW Virg.io script set.

## More info

[https://github.com/Virg-io-dev](https://github.com/Virg-io-dev)

This organization is used for the archival and development of a joke script I made known as Virg.in (put output) it is slightly NSFW but contains no sexual content. It is a play-on a plug n play term known as male and female plugs. The joke is that your device loses its virginity upon its first time plugging in and unplugging.

## Extra info

Virgin Vs Chad is the theme for this project, as I find the strip series to be funny.

The `-dev` was added, as [Virg-io](https://github.com/Virg-io/) was already taken.

The `.` is substitued with `-` as GitHub organizations cannot contain `.` in their name.

IO stands for Input Output. The projects name puts a pun on this.

This project involves a joke about the terms male and female adapters/plugs.
