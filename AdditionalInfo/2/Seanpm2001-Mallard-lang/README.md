This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in the Mallard programming language. The original rule was that Mallard had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any Mallard source code is included.

## Extra info

Mallard is the name of the language

Mallard is a recognized language by Gedit, but it doesn't appear to be recognized by GitHub yet.

The current logo in use is in JPEG format. This means that it is not transparent, but it does not need a background color replacement. I used a picture of a Mallard duck for the project, as it fits.

<!-- The official GitHub organization for Mallard is located at [QisKit](https://github.com/qiskit/)

The cloest official GitHub organization for Mallard is located at [null](#Not-found)

> Link to the supposed home repository (other languages) [Null](#Not-found)

I currently cannot figure out what file extension Mallard programs use.

<!-- The logo currently in use is in GIF format, but is not animated.!-->

<!-- I don't know what Mallard stands for, in the sense of programming languages. !-->

No other extra info is currently available.
