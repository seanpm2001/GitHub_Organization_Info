# GitHub organization: Kommunism-dev

## Description

Kommunism is a place to make Communist/Socialist programmer jokes.

## More info

[https://github.com/Kommunism-dev](https://github.com/Kommunism-dev/)

This project hosts archives and developments of the project Kommunism, a joke project for Communist and socialist programmer jokes, in an environment where the jokes can thrive.

## Extra info

Disclaimer: I am not a Communist, and this project is not intended to promote Communism. However, this project does not support Capitalism, and I am not a capitalist either.

I named this project after the way KDE names project, where the letter C is replaced with K. Unfortunately, it doesn't entirely work here, as Kommunism is German for Communism.

This project classifies as a political humor project, and thus a political project, and is delisted from my other projects. It may or may not be eligable for sponsors.

I am using a glossy K as the logo for now, as my plan for a modified KDE logo isn't available yet.

The home repository for this project lies at [seanpm2001/Kommunism](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Kommunism/)

This project was originally private in its early developments, but was made public on 2022, Friday, April 8th after officially launching its parent organization.

The original name `Kommunism` was already taken by another user, which is an inactive user.
