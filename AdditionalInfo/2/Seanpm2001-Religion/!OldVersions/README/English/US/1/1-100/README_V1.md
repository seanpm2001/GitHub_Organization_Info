# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-Religion

## Description

The Seanpm2001 GitHub organization for Religious software projects.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Religion](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Religion/)

This project hosts archives and developments of my projects in the field of Religious software.

## Extra info

This is a category project.

Some projects that belong here, but can't be forked yet include:

- [ ] SNU 2D Beliefs
- [ ] TempleOS source archives
- [ ] HolyC programs
- [ ] IsraeLinux

The logo for this project is derived from the SNU 2D Beliefs logo, which is derived from a Wikimedia source. Since the Y axis was 200 pixels off, I built a new version, without transparency. I hope to fix this in the future.
