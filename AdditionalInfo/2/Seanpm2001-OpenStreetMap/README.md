# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-OpenStreetMap

## Description

The Seanpm2001 GitHub organization for OpenStreetMap related projects and forks.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-OpenStreetMap](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-OpenStreetMap/)

This project hosts the development and archival of projects based on, or heavily relying on the OpenStreetMap site, and/or its APIs.

## Extra info

This is a category project.

I am using the official OpenStreetMap logo for this project.

<!-- As of 2022, May 27th, I don't have any projects that use for this organization yet. !-->

`OpenStreetMap` can be shortened to `OSM`

This project is mostly for archived projects. It is not for active projects, unless an active project is for archiving projects.

Due to my inability to fork GitHub repositories outside of my own account at the moment, this organization is empty.

The homepage for this project is located [`here (unavailable, there is no current home repository for this project)`](https://www.example.com)

The website/homepage for OSM lies [`here`](https://www.openstreetmap.org/)

The development organization (GitHub) for OSM lies [`here`](https://github.com/openstreetmap/)

> The main development repository (GitHub) for OSM lies [`here`](https://github.com/openstreetmap/openstreetmap-website/)
