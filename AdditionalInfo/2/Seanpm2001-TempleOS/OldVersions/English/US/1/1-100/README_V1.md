# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-TempleOS

## Description

The Seanpm2001 GitHub organization for software projects related to the TempleOS operating system.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-TempleOS](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-TempleOS/)

This project hosts archives and developments of my projects in the field of TempleOS and TempleOS software, a very niche platform.

## Extra info

This is a category project. It is part of the [Seanpm2001-Religion](/AdditionalInfo/2/Seanpm2001-Religion/) category.

Some projects that belong here, but can't be forked yet include:

- [ ] TempleOS source archives
- [ ] HolyC programs

The logo for this project is a framed version of the TempleOS logo. I have used the same logo in the past on [Seanpm2001-HolyC-lang](/AdditionalInfo/2/Seanpm2001-HolyC-lang/) but this time, it is using a different filename. Having both projects use the same logo is OK, as they are both part of the same category.
