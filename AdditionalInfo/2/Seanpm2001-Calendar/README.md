# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-Calendar

## Description

The Seanpm2001 GitHub organization for Calendar related projects and forks.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Calendar](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Calendar/)

This project hosts the development and archival of projects and forks related to software calendars.

## Extra info

This is a category project.

I am using the iOS 6 calendar icon for this project. The date on this icon is Sunday, 25th. This has no significant meaning, it is just an icon, although the icon has a black background that needs to be removed.

<!--
As of 2022, May 27th, I don't have any projects that use for this organization yet.
!-->

Due to my inability to fork GitHub repositories outside of my own account at the moment, this organization is empty.

The homepage for this project is located [`here (unavailable, there is no current home repository for this project)`](https://www.example.com)
