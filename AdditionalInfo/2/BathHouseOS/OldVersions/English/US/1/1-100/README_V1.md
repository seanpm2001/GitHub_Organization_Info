## More info

[https://github.com/BathHouseOS](https://github.com/BathHouseOS/)

This project is for archives and developments of the BathHouseOS project, a cluster of basic open source operating systems for various bathroom appliances. The software is written in nesC and Verilog, and utilizes the TinyOS kernel.

## Extra info

This project uses a generic shower icon, originally from a watermarked image, where I removed the watermark from. It should be changed in the future.

The description was cut off due to a character limit. The last line should read:

```plain-text
Written in nesC and Verilog, designed for TinyOS.
```

Since I can't fork projects at the moment, this organization is currently empty.

The home repository for this project, lies at [seanpm2001/BathHouseOS](https://github.com/seanpm2001/BathHouseOS/)
