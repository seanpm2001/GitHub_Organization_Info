# GitHub organization: Cyborg-System-Monitor

## Description

For the archival and development of the Cyborg System Monitor project, a mix between computer and human for system monitors.

## More info

[https://github.com/Cyborg-System-Monitor](https://github.com/Cyborg-System-Monitor)

This organization is used for the archival and development of my Cyborg System Monitor project, which is a skin/standalone project for a system monitor with both digital and organic meters. It is designed to be a mix of the 2 (robots, and humans/other animals)

## Extra info

This project is still very early in development.

An image of the GNOME System Monitor was used for the organization photo, as the project was originally designed to be a reskin of it. I have now expanded it to have its own monitor.
