# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-Singularity-lang

## Description

For the archival and development of my projects written in the Singularity programming language, or containing Singularity source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Singularity-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Singularity-lang/)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in Singularity. The original rule was that Singularity had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any Singularity code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

## Extra info

I discovered this language via GitHub.

I felt the main logo for Singularity was too generic, so I used a more detailed one.

<!-- Singularity doesn't have an official logo, so I used the best alternative I could find. !-->
