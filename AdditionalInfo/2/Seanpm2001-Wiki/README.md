# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-Wiki

## Description

For the archival and development of my Wiki projects.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Wiki](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Wiki/)

This project hosts my projects related to Wikis, Wiki programming, and Wiki documentation. This includes, but is not limited to: Wikipedia, GitHub Wikis, WikiText files, etc.

## Extra info

I am using a PNG version of the Wikipedia logo. It is the most recognizable icon, and it is free to use. I would use an SVG version, but GitHub doesn't fully support SVG yet, especially in the context of a profile picture or social preview image.
