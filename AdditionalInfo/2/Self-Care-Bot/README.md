# GitHub organization: Self-Care-Bot

## Description

For the archival and development of the self-care bot self care program suite.

## More info

[https://github.com/Self-Care-Bot](https://github.com/Self-Care-Bot/)

This organization is used for the archival and development of my self-care bot project, a suite of tools wrapped into a helpful bot utility, designed to help people with self care help and reminders.

## Extra info

I originally forgot to do this project during my late Spring, early Summer 2021 organization phase, but found that it wasn't created yet, so I did that on 2021, August 12th.
