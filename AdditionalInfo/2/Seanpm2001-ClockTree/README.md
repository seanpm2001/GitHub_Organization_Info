# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-ClockTree

For the archival and development of my ClockTree related projects.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-ClockTree](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-ClockTree/)

This project hosts archives and developments of my work related to the ClockTree video conferencing platform.

## Extra info

This project is still a work in progress.

ClockTree is my alternative to Zoom (spyware) I am glad I was given the choice, as I absolutely hate Zoom (spyware)

I am still trying to find a way to scrub sensitive data from this project, there is a lot of it.
