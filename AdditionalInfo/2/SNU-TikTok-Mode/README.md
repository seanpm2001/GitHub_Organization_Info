# GitHub organization: SNU-TikTok-Mode

## Description

For the archival and development of the SNU TikTok mode package, SNUs implementation of recreating various versions of TikTok.

## More info

[https://github.com/SNU-TikTok-Mode](https://github.com/SNU-TikTok-Mode/)

This project hosts archives and developments of the SNU TikTok mode module/package, which is SNUs implementation of the TikTok platform.

## Extra info

This project is still very early in development.

Some of the key differences between the SNU TikTok module and TikTok itself is:

- [x] This project is open source
- [x] This project isn't owned by a Chinese company
- [x] This project doesn't contain privacy risks (such as data mining, trackers, etc.)

This project is currently written in WebAssembly, but might change in the future.

This project uses the default SNU icon. I might use a modified logo in the future, but I currently don't have plans for it.

The home repository for this project (in 2D mode) lies at [seanpm2001/SNU_2D_TikTokMode](https://github.com/seanpm2001/SNU_2D_TikTokMode/)
