# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-Coverage

## Description

The Seanpm2001 GitHub organization for my source code coverage projects and forks.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Coverage](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Coverage/)

This project hosts the development and archival of projects that are for source code coverage.

## Extra info

This is a category project.

I am using a minimalist logo for this project that I don't like. I couldn't find anything else that fits. Along with this, I didn't notice until the next day that the image is faking transparency (the PNG transparency checker texture is part of the image, and not part of the image viewer) I really don't know how that slipped through, I check really thoroughly for this.

This category is for all my source code coverage projects and forks.

<!--
As of 2022, May 27th, I don't have any projects that use for this organization yet.

Due to my inability to fork GitHub repositories outside of my own account at the moment, this organization is empty.

The homepage for this project is located [`here (unavailable, there is no current home repository for this project)`](https://www.example.com)
