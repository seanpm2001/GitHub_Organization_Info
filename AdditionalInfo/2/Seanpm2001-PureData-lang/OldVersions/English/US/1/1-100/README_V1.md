# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-PureData-lang

## Description

For the archival and development of my projects written in the PureData programming language, or containing PureData source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-PureData-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-PureData-lang/)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in the PureData programming language. The original rule was that PureData had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any PureData source code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

## Extra info

PureData is the name of the language.

PureData is a recognized language by GitHub.

The PureData language is written mostly in C.

The PureData language is a visual programming language (block-based, like Scratch) but also contains plain text source code.

The PureData language is an audio/music language used to generate music and sound effects.

The current logo in use is in JPEG format. This means that it is not transparent, but it still looks good in light or dark mode, due to how it is laid out.

PureData is the 3rd language I have encountered that starts with the word `pure` (the other 2 are [`PureBasic`](/AdditionalInfo/2/Seanpm2001-PureBasic-lang/) and [`PureScript`](/AdditionalInfo/1/Seanpm2001-PureScript-lang/))

<!-- The logo currently in use is in GIF format, but is not animated.!-->

<!--I don't know what PureData-lang stands for, in the sense of programming languages. !-->

No other extra info available.
