# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-VideoLAN

## Description

The Seanpm2001 GitHub organization for VideoLAN related projects and forks. 

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-VideoLAN](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-VideoLAN/)

This project hosts the development and archival of projects and forks related to the VideoLAN organization.

## Extra info

This is a category project.

I am using the VideoLAN forum `VideoLAN` rank logo, as it is the only square logo I could find that fits. I didn't want to use the VLC logo for this project.

The logo in use is very low quality (a mini logo inside a 200x200 frame) and is in GIF format. Despite being in GIF format, it is not animated. It also lacks transparency, and has a white background. It will need to be changed in the future.

This category is for all my `VideoLAN` projects and forks, including other VideoLan projects (and not just VLC Media Player)

<!--
As of 2022, May 27th, I don't have any projects that use for this organization yet.

Due to my inability to fork GitHub repositories outside of my own account at the moment, this organization is empty.

The homepage for this project is located [`here (unavailable, there is no current home repository for this project)`](https://www.example.com)
