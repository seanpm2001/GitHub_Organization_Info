For the archival and development of my projects written in the HAML programming language, or containing HAML source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-HAML-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-HAML-lang/)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in HAML. The original rule was that HAML had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any HAML code is included.
