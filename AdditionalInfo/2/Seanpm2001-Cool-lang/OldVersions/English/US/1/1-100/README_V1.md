This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in the Cool programming language. The original rule was that Cool had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any Cool source code is included.

## Extra info

<details open><summary><p lang="en">Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section</p></summary>

Cool is the name of the language

Cool is a recognized language by GitHub.

I don't know who the main developer of the Cool programming language is.

This name causes a little bit of an issue here: I am not using the slang term to define "cool" programming languages or "cool" projects/repositories, just projects with the `cool` programming language.

The current logo in use is in JPEG format. This means that it is transparent, but it does not need background color replacement. I am using a generic logo, as Cool doesn't appear to have its own logo.

Cool programs have the `.cl` file extension.

The official GitHub organization for Cool is located at [Unknown](https://github.com/)

<!-- I currently cannot figure out what file extension Cool programs use. !-->

<!-- The logo currently in use is in GIF format, but is not animated.!-->

<!--I don't know what Cool-lang stands for, in the sense of programming languages. !-->

No other extra info is currently available.
