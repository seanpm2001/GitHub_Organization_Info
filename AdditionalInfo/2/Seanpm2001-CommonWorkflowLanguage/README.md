This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in the Common Workflow Language programming language. The original rule was that Common Workflow Language had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any Common Workflow Language source code is included.

## Extra info

Common Workflow Language is the name of the language

Common Workflow Language is a recognized language by GitHub.

Common Workflow Language can be shortened to `cwl` or `commonWL`

The current logo in use is in PNG format. This means that it is transparent, and it does not need background color fixes. I am using the official logo, which has transparency.

CommonWorkflowLanguage programs have the `.cwl` file extension.

The official GitHub organization for Common Workflow Language is located at [Common-Workflow-Language](https://github.com/common-workflow-language/)
