This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in the Cap'n Proto programming language. The original rule was that Cap'n Proto had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any Cap'n Proto source code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

## Extra info

<details open><summary><p lang="en">Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section</p></summary>

Cap'n Proto is the name of the language

Cap'n Proto is a recognized language by GitHub.

Cap'n Proto is a data serialization language.

The current logo in use is in PNG format. This means that it is not transparent, but it does not need background color replacement.

Cap'n Proto programs have the `.capnp` file extensions.

Cap'n Proto is jokingly named after the Cap'n Crunch **Cereal** which is tongue in cheek to this being a **Serialization** language.

The official GitHub organization for Cap'n Proto is located at [Cap-n-Proto](https://github.com/capnproto/)

> Link to the home repository (C++) [Capnproto/Capnproto](https://github.com/capnproto/capnproto)

<!-- I currently cannot figure out what file extension Cap-n-Proto programs use. !-->

<!-- The logo currently in use is in GIF format, but is not animated.!-->

<!--I don't know what Cap-n-Proto-lang stands for, in the sense of programming languages. !-->

No other extra info is currently available.
