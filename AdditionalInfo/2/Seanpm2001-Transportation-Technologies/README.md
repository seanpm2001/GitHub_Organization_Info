# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-Transportation-Technologies

## Description

My GitHub organization for my transport technology projects and forks.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Transportation-Technologies](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Transportation-Technologies/)

This project hosts archives, development, and research information for my projects (and other users projects) regarding digital/physical transportation.

## Extra info

This is one of the ways I can support open source efforts to fields such as self-driving electric cars, vehicle operating system, and more, as I already planned to not delve into the field myself.

The logo has 2 arrows in 2 directions, signaling travel locations. I didn't choose a picture of a car or a plane, or another vehicle, as this is not a project based on 1 subject. See below definition.

The definition for Transportation Technologies for this project is moving data, cargo, and or people from 1 destination to another.
