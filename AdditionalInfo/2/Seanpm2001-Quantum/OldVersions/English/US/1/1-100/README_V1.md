# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-Quantum

## Description

My GitHub organization for my quantum computing projects and forks. Goal: Quantum computer public general availability by 2042

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Quantum](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Quantum/)

This project hosts archives, research, and development related to Quantum Computers and Quantum Computer software.

## Extra info

Quantum Computers have been a goal for me since 2013, although I didn't realize the platforms name until about 2018 or 2019.

A new goal I am setting is public general availability of a quantum computer by the year 2042 AD (general availability means the device costs less than $5000 in 2021 December 31st money)

A miscellaneous image of Quantum physics is used as the logo, as I couldn't find what I was originally looking for (a superposition of 0 and 1, (a qbit)) this image is fine, and will stay for now.
