# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-Thrift-lang

## Description

For the archival and development of my projects written in the Thrift programming language, or containing Thrift source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Thrift-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Thrift-lang/)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in the Thrift programming language. The original rule was that Thrift had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any Thrift source code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

## Extra info

Thrift is the name of the language.

Thrift is a recognized language by GitHub.

I couldn't find a logo for this language, so I am using a book about learning the Thrift programming language, as it is close as I can get.

Thrift is an Apache foundation language, officially known as Apache Thrift.

The current logo in use is in JPEG format. This means that it is not transparent, although it has no background color issues.

Thrift programs have the `.thrift` file extension.

<!-- I currently cannot figure out what file extension Thrift programs use. !-->

<!-- The logo currently in use is in GIF format, but is not animated.!-->

<!--I don't know what Thrift-lang stands for, in the sense of programming languages. !-->

No other extra info available.
