# GitHub organization: Oh-Hi-Markdown

## Description

For the archival and development of the `Oh hi Markdown` joke project, a parody of the movie `the room`

## More info

[https://github.com/Oh-Hi-Markdown](https://github.com/Oh-Hi-Markdown/)

This project hosts the development and archival of projects and forks related to projects I made under my original username (@Oh-Hi-Markdown) which was used only for my [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/Oh-Hi-Markdown/) account (my first public and posting social media account, starting 2015 March 2nd)

## Extra info

This is a category project.

I am using a generic markdown icon, as it fits the project well, and I shouldn't spend too much time on it, since it is a one time joke.
