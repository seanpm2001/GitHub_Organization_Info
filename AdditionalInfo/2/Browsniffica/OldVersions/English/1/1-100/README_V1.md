# GitHub organization: Browsniffica

## Description

Browsniffica is a user agent and profile changer, which lets you pretend to be any browser. This can open up access to new sites, or test existing ones.

## More info

[https://github.com/Browsniffica](https://github.com/Browsniffica/)

This project hosts archives and developments of the project Browsniffica, a user agent switcher used for testing how a webpage will display on different browsers, without having to use a different browser.

## Extra info

This project is still a work in progress.

Browsniffica is a portmanteau of browser sniffing, and ica.

This project uses 2 icons. I couldn't use the original, as GitHub doesn't allow SVG images in profile pictures, and the original image is in SVG format. I exported it to PNG, but kept both versions. You can use the dropdowns to show/hide the preferred one. The raster (PNG) version is hidden by default.
