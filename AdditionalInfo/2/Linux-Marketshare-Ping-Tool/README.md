# GitHub organization: Linux-Marketshare-Ping-Tool

## Description

For the archival and development of the Linux Marketshare Ping Tool scriptkit, a tool to better determine Linux marketshare.

## More info

[https://github.com/Linux-Marketshare-Ping-Tool](https://github.com/Linux-Marketshare-Ping-Tool)

This organization is used for the archival and development of my Linux Marketshare Ping Tool script set, which is a tool that pings certain servers to let the world know another device is using Linux. A user must run the script themselves to actually register. Not all Linux distributions tell you how many users they have, that is why Linux Marketshare numbers are reported far lower than what they actually are.

## Extra info

This project is still very early in development.
