# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-Mustache-lang

## Description

For the archival and development of my projects written in the Mustache programming language, or containing Mustache source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Mustache-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Mustache-lang/)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in Mustache. The original rule was that Mustache had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any Mustache code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

## Extra info

This was a language I originally forgot to create an organization for. It is now documented.

Mustache is a Ruby template language.

The name `mustache` is in reference to how a curly bracket `{` `}` looks like a mustache.

I currently cannot find a higher resolution version of the logo.
