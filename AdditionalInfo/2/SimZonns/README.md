## Description

For the development of SimZonns, the next generation open source SIM card virtual machine format.

## More info

[https://github.com/SimZonns](https://github.com/SimZonns)

This organization is used for the archival and development of my SimZonns SIM card project (pronounced: Sim Zawns) which hosts virtualization of classical SIM cards, and virtualization of a more advanced, future-proofed SIM card implementation, all of which is open source.

## Extra info

I wanted to use Simpsons branding for this project, but I can't due to copyright. I was hoping the community could contain Simpsons references, as that is what I was aiming for, but it might not be possible due to copyright from 20th Century Fox.
