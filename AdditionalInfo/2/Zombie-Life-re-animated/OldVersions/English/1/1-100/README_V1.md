## More info

[https://github.com/Zombie-Life-re-animated](https://github.com/Zombie-Life-re-animated/)

This project hosts archives and developments of the project Zombie Life re-animated, an open source recreation of the 4 zombie games by the defunct video game company "ThePlayForge"

## Extra info

This project is still a work in progress.

This project is written in C++ for the best cross-platform support.

An alternate name for this project is re-"re"-animated, as a Zombie is re-animated, while this is a re-animation of the re-animation.

This project is an open source recreation and alternate to the following 4 games: Zombie Life, Zombie Farm, Zombie Farm Escape, Zombie Farm 2.

I am using the icon of the original Zombie Life game as a placeholder for now.

The **[ProTraApp](/AdditionalInfo/1/ProTraApp/)** software LIBrary is in use for this project as a way to demonstrate its usage, even though I didn't need to use it, since I could have just combined them all in one. I wanted to do things differently for this project.
