## Extra info

I have yet to differentiate the [@seanpm2001-AI](/AdditionalInfo/2/Seanpm2001-AI/) organization from the [@seanpm2001-Artificial-Intelligence](/AdditionalInfo/2/Seanpm2001-Artificial-Intelligence) organizations. They both are mirrors of each other right now.

The logo is a picture of an example of neurotic activity.
