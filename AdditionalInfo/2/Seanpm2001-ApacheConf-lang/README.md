# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-ApacheConf-lang

## Description

For the archival and development of my projects written in the ApacheConf programming language, or containing ApacheConf source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-ApacheConf-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-ApacheConf-lang/)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in the ApacheConf language. The original rule was that ApacheConf had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any ApacheConf code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

## Extra info

This language is used to configure Apache projects.

I am using the file [`PoweredByApache.png`](/AdditionalInfo/2/Seanpm2001-ApacheConf-lang/PoweredByApache.png) again, as I forgot I had previously used it, and also couldn't find a relevant picture I haven't used that I can use. The logo may be changed in the future.
