# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-Fluent-lang

## Description

For the archival and development of my projects written in the Fluent programming language, or containing Fluent source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Fluent-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Fluent-lang/)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in the Fluent programming language. The original rule was that Fluent had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any Fluent source code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

## Extra info

Fluent is the name of the language.

Fluent is a recognized language by GitHub.

I couldn't find a logo for this language, so I am using a fancy F typeface as the logo for now.

<!-- The current logo in use is in JPEG format. This means that it is not transparent, but it needs a replacement without a solid white background. !-->

<!-- Fluent programs have the `.moon` file extension. !-->

I currently cannot figure out what file extension fluent programs use.

<!-- The logo currently in use is in GIF format, but is not animated.!-->

<!--I don't know what Fluent-lang stands for, in the sense of programming languages. !-->

No other extra info available.
