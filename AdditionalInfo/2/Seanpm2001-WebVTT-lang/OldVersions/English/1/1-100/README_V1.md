# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-WebVTT-lang

## Description

For the development of my projects written in the WebVTT language, or containing WebVTT source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-WebVTT-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-WebVTT-lang)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in WebVTT. The original rule was that WebVTT had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any WebVTT code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

## Extra info

The icon for closed captioning was used, as WebVTT doesn't have its own official icon, and WebVTT is basically just closed captioning, so I chose that for this GitHub organizations icon.
