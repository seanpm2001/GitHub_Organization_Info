## Extra info

This is a category project.

This project hosts archives and developments of my projects related to software that is UNIX-like (including UNIX) which includes but is not limited to:

* BSD
> * NeXTSTEP
> > * OpenSTEP
> > > * MacOS
* Linux
> * Too many to list

The logo of this project is a generic UNIX icon I found that is historic. I chose the lower quality GIF version over the detailed PNG version, as I found the GIF to look more convincing.

The logo in use is in GIF format. However, it is NOT an animated GIF.
