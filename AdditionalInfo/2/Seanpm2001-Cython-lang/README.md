# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-Cython-lang

## Description

For the archival and development of my projects written in the Cython programming language, or containing Cython source code.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Cython-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Cython-lang/)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in the Cython programming language. The original rule was that Cython had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any Cython source code is included.

Learn more about the language organization setup [by clicking/tapping here](/AdditionalInfo/LanguageOrgs/README.md)

## Extra info

Cython is the name of the language.

Cython is for converting Python source code to C source code.

The logo I am using has a really small Cython logo, with lots of white space. It was a good resolution image, that is why I chose it.

Cython is a recognized language by GitHub, as of 2022 February 25th.

Cython uses the Python logo with the letter C encircling it as its logo.

<!--The logo currently in use is in GIF format, but is not animated. !-->

<!--I don't know what Cython stands for, in the sense of programming languages. !-->

No other extra info available.
