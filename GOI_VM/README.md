## About

The GOI Virtual Machine is a development feature where organizations can be created on GitHub in a different, more portable way. These are not true organizations, they can't directly hold usernames or forks, but they can act like they do. It is basically an offline organization viewer, since I had to forfeit all of my organizations due to an unfair GitHub ToS rule (I wasn't even cybersquatting)

It will look identical to a GitHub organization webpage. This will serve as my alternate until (and also after) I get my personal file server setup.

This is a personal use project at the moment.
